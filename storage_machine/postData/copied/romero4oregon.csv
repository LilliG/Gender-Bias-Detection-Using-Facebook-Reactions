"Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for Congress, US Senator, Oregon,Daniel Bonham",Daniel Bonham,2020-02-25 14:42:43,"The table is tilted, the cards have been marked, and the dice are loaded. Since day one, Cap and trade has been rigged to achieve a politically motivated outcome. Republicans have repeatedly come to the table but Democrats have rejected any attempt to have rural concerns addressed. They have said no to every Republican amendment, they have - without a clear explanation - refused to send the measure before voters, and have chosen to advance cap-and-trade without a complete fiscal and revenue analyses. Yesterday, lacking the votes to advance SB 1530 out of committee, they again changed the rules to deploy a rarely used procedural maneuver to advance the bill to the Senate floor by any means necessary. Instead of taking a step back and choosing to prioritize the bipartisan budget bills and policy tweaks that would be appropriate for a short session, House Democrats chose to abuse the legislative process further by introducing new measures to rig electoral outcomes favorable to their special interest donors. Oregonians, not the special interests, deserve a voice in this process.  House Republicans will no longer stand for the repeated abuses of the short session by Governor Kate Brown and the majority party. We have maintained that opportunities for compromise exist, but efforts to achieve consensus have been rejected at every turn. As of today, we have reached an impasse. We support the actions of our Republicans in the Senate and we intend to join them in their protest of the blatant disrespect for the legislative process and the voters of Oregon.

"Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for Congress, US Senator, Oregon,OWFT 2020 Public",OWFT 2020 Public,2020-02-20 13:11:10,"ATTENTION: If you are a registered Republican, you have every right to know a few things that happen behind the scenes of the ORP. This is very long but VERY important! I implore you to take the time to read and then SHARE and email to every Republican in Oregon that you know. Especially to those voting in the upcoming elections. As the figures attached show, Oregon Republicans have been losing for about 15 years. They have lost regardless of the fact that Oregon grass-roots voters on average favor Republican policies, and Oregon Republican County Parties have worked hard and effectively. My purpose in writing this article is to explain why I think we need a new National Committeeman. Solomon Yue has been National Committeeman for almost 20 years. He is one of the most skilled political operatives in Oregon. Unfortunately, he has not used these talents for Oregon and instead has been harmful to Republican candidates and policies. Republicans have lost because of failure of the Oregon State Republican Party, which is completely controlled by Solomon Yue and his ‚Äúfixer‚Äù Jeff Grossman. Having served one term as Oregon State Republican Party Chairman and having been nominated five times as the Republican candidate for Oregon District 4 Congress, I am very familiar with the cause of this failure. 1. At an ORP Executive Committee meeting during my term as Chairman, I looked at the Committee, which contained some very affluent individuals ‚Äì far more wealthy than myself, and said, ‚ÄúI notice that the entire sum of contributions to the ORP from all of you combined is only about $300.‚Äù (I personally donated about $25,000 to the ORP during that term and loaned the ORP about $25,000 more). Tyler Smith was apparently the only other donor. Solomon Yue immediately objected. ‚ÄúI pay all of my expenses of about $10,000 as National Committeeman. That‚Äôs my contribution!‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI think you are doing OK.‚Äù Solomon replied, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs debate that here right now Solomon.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll include the money you paid to yourself from Independent Expenditures to one of my own congressional races.‚Äù Solomon paled and looked around for some way to exit the room. (He was on the wrong side from the door.) There was no debate. You see, Solomon, during my 2012 campaign, had paid himself personally $80,000 and paid additional amounts to his political associates from Independent expenditures supporting my candidacy. In addition he handled television work and printing work arranged outside of Oregon and near his friends. Printing and TV usually involves handsome financial kickbacks. (These kickbacks are not publicly reported.) These funds all came from about $600,000 that was intended to help my election effort. The contributors were affluent people who had similarly helped my campaign in an earlier race. Solomon did not locate or recruit these donors. Solomon had approached me after my first campaign, during which I received no help from the Republican Party and lost to DeFazio by 9 points. Solomon said that he was a high official of the Republican Party and that the Republican Party thought I could win next time, so they wanted to help me. The help later turned out to be the formation of this $600,000 ‚Äúsuper pac‚Äù funded by my previous supporters, controlled by Solomon, and operated counterproductive. Ironically, during that same campaign, Solomon advised my campaign to spread a rumor that a Republican officer in CD4, whom Solomon disliked, had pretended to be a volunteer while making money from his political work. We did not take that advice. A lot of money passes through Solomon‚Äôs hands. For example, interests in Taiwan apparently pay for his sponsorship and Republicans outside of the U.S. make substantial contributions. Solomon and his retainers do very well from this. 2. While driving to an Executive Committee meeting one evening, I received a call from a colleague urging me to immediately contact one of the county parties. The colleague told me that the county had just that day elected a new Chairman, and that Solomon Yue and his fixer Jeff Grossman had attended the election and were telling the new Chairman that I, Art Robinson as ORP Chair, would use my authority to unseat him because I thought he would not support me. Actually, I did not know that the county had held an election, and I did not even know the man who had been elected! Solomon describes this kind of activity in Chinese terms that he says he learned as a very successful student in Maoist China. The Chinese strategy, according to Solomon, advises the defeat of an opponent by ‚ÄúDrying the grass, waiting for a wind, and lighting a fire.‚Äù The ‚Äúwind‚Äù is the advent of some issue that can be distorted to use against the opponent, and the ‚Äúfire‚Äù is the public contest. Most important is ‚Äúdrying the grass,‚Äù which involves a stealth whispering campaign of lies to ruin the future opponent‚Äôs reputation before the ‚Äúwind‚Äù arises. In my case, Solomon and Grossman constantly ‚Äúdried the grass‚Äù under me, an ORP Chairman who refused to be their vassal and because I am a pro-liberty Republican, rather than one who submits to the statist goals of establishment friends and contacts to obtain public office. As soon as I was elected as ORP Chair, my reputation became the target of a lot of grass drying. When I began a direct mail fund raising campaign, an unprincipled and false whispering campaign was initiated claiming that I was doing so just to get control of the ORP mailing list for my own personal use. Actually, just the mailing list of people donating to my own congressional campaigns was already 10 times larger than the ORP donor list under Solomon Yue. When I discovered after my election as Chairman that the ORP was out of funds and had $30,000 in unpaid obligations besides, I ordered that no more salaries be paid or obligations incurred until the finances recovered. The office staff would have to work as volunteers. A few months earlier, retiring Chair Allen Alley had paid all ORP bills up to date and left $40,000 in the treasury. That money had then been paid, in significant part, to ORP insiders. The grass drying campaign then circulated a false rumor that I had laid off the staff so that I could put my children into paid secretarial positions in the ORP office. My six ‚Äúchildren‚Äù included five with doctoral degrees in medicine, science, and engineering and one still working toward a doctorate ‚Äì an unlikely group to be seeking paper shuffling jobs for the ORP. Still this was an effective lie, which was actively circulated for many months. You see, most central committee members did not know of the accomplishments of these young people. Solomon Yue has stayed in office in the ORP for two decades largely by means of numerous whispering campaigns by himself and his retainers used to influence Central Committee voters and ruin the reputations of opponents. In 2016, however, he gained re-election by only 8 votes, running against Perry Atkinson. Perry had been a very successful two-term ORP Chairman who presided while more than $9 million was raised for the ORP. (Actual contributions, not the bogus more than $1 million recently claimed by Solomon-controlled Bill Currier, which was actually just a financial pass through in order to use the ORP mailing permit. The ORP Treasurer provided to the Central Committee the accurate very small income amount to the ORP from this mailing work.) It was difficult to dry the grass under Perry, so a different tactic was used. A group of Solomon retainers was organized to inundate Perry with apparently independent calls demanding he withdraw because his candidacy was tearing the ORP apart. Perry, a very mild mannered and likable man, almost did withdraw as a result. Ultimately, he remained a candidate but campaigned very little ‚Äì giving Solomon his 8 vote margin. 3. Solomon has been using the ORP as a foreign lobbying base for the country of Taiwan. He really should register as an agent for a foreign country. He takes Taiwan functionaries to Republican events (at a price) and uses his position to provide them with valuable access to politically powerful people. He even orchestrated an ORP resolution favoring Taiwan. Foreign policy is the province of the President of the United States. It is not the responsibility of state Republican parties. The ORP does not use its position to lobby for Canada, or Mexico, or Germany, or France, or other foreign countries. Yet, Solomon uses his position as Oregon National Committeeman and his access to the ORP and RNC to lobby for Taiwan. 4. The successful effort by Solomon, Grossman, and their friends to drive ORP Chair Suzanne Gallagher out of office, their failed efforts to do the same to Art Robinson, and their final victory in putting their retainer Bill Currier into office (through whispering campaigns and lies about his far more qualified opponent, Wally Hicks) are well known. Suzanne was driven from office because she thought she was ORP Chair. She did not realize she was expected to be a stand-in for Solomon Yue. After she resigned, I permitted my nomination because my family and I decided that this was a fine opportunity to help more than 100 Republican candidates win office. We have the skills to do so. Wally Hicks was subjected to a false whispering campaign saying that he had lied ‚Äì that he had not really graduated from the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Meanwhile, Currier bragged that he had many very large donors lined up who would fund the ORP lavishly if he were elected. Wally had actually raised $400,000 in his spare time for the Richardson gubernatorial campaign, but he was positioned by Solomon and friends as being unable to raise money. After Currier was elected, it was found that Currier‚Äôs advertised large donors did not exist. When I took office, it was expected that I would raise substantial money for the ORP. I have more than 40 years of experience in doing this for scientific institutions, and have the necessary skills. So, Solomon, Grossman, and retainers immediately attacked my efforts. They knew that they could not control me and were determined that I would fail. First, they manipulated the Executive Committee, in meeting after meeting, where it was alleged that my election over Bill Currier was fraudulent. These claims were even leaked to the Oregonian, whose reporter questioned me about this. One cannot approach affluent donors with an active cloud like this positioned over his head. The matter was finally settled in a November Central Committee vote that was overwhelmingly in my favor. I then told Margie Hughes to start arranging appointments. My plan was to personally visit every individual we could locate who had given substantial financial help to the ORP in the past. I told Margie to arrange the appointments for January and February. The election was the next November. Instead, at a January 6 Executive Committee meeting, Jeff Grossman threw out the meeting agenda by means of an obviously prearranged vote by Solomon Yue retainers and then proposed an agenda with 14 points of restrictions on my activities. The 14 points were essentially a complete list of all of the Chair‚Äôs duties, resources, and responsibilities, which Grossman‚Äôs motion ordered cancelled. Grossman‚Äôs motion was an effort to recall the ORP Chair from office, a power that the Executive Committee does not have. Solomon‚Äôs retainers passed this motion easily and advertised the vote throughout Oregon. Bill Currier then ‚Äúoffered‚Äù to assume my duties. I refused to comply. Yet, I now knew that Solomon had the votes to redirect any money I raised away from the donor‚Äôs wishes. Meeting with donors and convincing them to support specific activities when I knew I could not fulfill obligations to them was impossible. So, I made a third effort. The ORP Chair appoints the members of the budget committee, and the budget must be rigorously followed. I appointed Republicans of good reputation, some I knew and some I did not ‚Äì one from each congressional district ‚Äì and proposed to them a budget that contained specific plans to help candidates and county parties. This budget also contained prohibitions on wasting the money on insiders. The committee passed this budget unanimously. The Executive Committee, with a majority of Solomon‚Äôs retainers, then rejected this budget and substituted a budget Solomon had produced, which put money in a very large slush fund that they could spend at will. Jeff Grossman commented at the Executive Committee meeting that he liked this fund because Robinson would probably not raise that much money, so he could advertise that Robinson had failed. Therefore, I put my budget forward at a Central Committee meeting in opposition to Solomon‚Äôs. The Solomon Yue group conducted a very intense lobbying effort, the members were confused, and my budget was narrowly defeated. In addition to these three failures to put myself in a credible position to approach affluent donors, I tried one additional effort. I appointed Ames Curtright as Finance Chair of the ORP, a position that unfortunately requires Executive Committee approval. ORP by-laws have been changed extensively by means of Grossman‚Äôs activities during Solomon‚Äôs terms of office in order to move more and more authority away from the Central Committee and into the Executive Committee. Solomon and Grossman consider the Central Committee generally a nuisance that they must continually manipulate. Ames Curtright agreed to donate $25,000 to the ORP and to arrange at least four identical contributions from his associates. With this $125,000 in hand, he would work vigorously to raise much more. This is a common way in which a finance chair is chosen and functions. An affluent donor is appointed who begins by donating and then raising money from his affluent friends. So, Ames attended the Executive committee scheduled to confirm his position. Tyler Smith, ORP attorney, led off with a strong endorsement of Ames. Then, however, it was Solomon Yue‚Äôs turn. Knowing Ames to be a justifiably proud man, Solomon extensively and egregiously insulted Ames. I was astonished when Ames just replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to fight with you. I just want to raise some money.‚Äù So, it was Grossman‚Äôs turn. Grossman was also very insulting and included even an insult to Ames‚Äôs Christian faith. Ames (who is now deceased) was a very devout Christian. When Grossman finished, I was again astonished. Ames simply said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to fight with you. I just want to raise some money‚Äù. So, the committee‚Äôs Solomon Yue retainers, including Currier, went to work on Ames with further insults. Finally, Ames had enough. He looked at Solomon and Grossman and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll write that $25,000 check right now if you two will resign.‚Äù Then, of course, Solomon‚Äôs majority on the committee voted down Ames‚Äôs appointment as Finance Chair. Several other ORP Chairs have reported similar problems with Solomon Yue. Solomon‚Äôs extensive and unprincipled activities to remain as National Committeeman have almost nothing to do with electing Oregon Republican candidates to office ‚Äì the primary mission of the ORP. I estimate that the ORP could have put at least 3 more Republicans into the Oregon legislature by no more effort than that Solomon‚Äôs people expended in trying to drive me from office. Solomon‚Äôs apparent personal and political interests are to control the ORP for monetary gain and (far more important than the money) to use the ORP as a platform keep himself in membership on the Republican National Committee. There he makes a lot of mischief. In 2012, Solomon was a vigorous pro-Romney opponent of Ron Paul, and a very strong supporter of Mitt Romney. He orchestrated anti-Ron Paul activities in the ORP that drove many idealistic young Republicans out of the ORP. Nationally, Solomon and Grossman were instrumental in writing an RNC rule change that prevented Ron Paul‚Äôs primary-won delegates from being counted. It was obvious that Romney would be the nominee, but Ron Paul‚Äôs supporters wanted him to be recognized. The rule change, however, prevented this. This was part of the Mitt Romney effort to keep Ron Paul from participating in the convention. In 2016, Solomon vigorously opposed Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. He favored establishment candidates like Jeb Bush. There was a problem, however, with the rule change he had orchestrated in 2012 against Ron Paul. The last hope of the anti-Trump and anti-Cruz people was that neither would receive a majority on the first ballot. This could create a brokered convention wherein a Bush or related candidate could be brought forward. Yet, only Cruz and Trump qualified under Solomon‚Äôs own RNC rule from 2012. Others could not be considered. So, Solomon engaged in a vigorous fight against Reince Priebus, because Reince was unwilling to change Solomon‚Äôs rule back to the original so late in the primaries. When I was ORP Chairman, I attended RNC meetings and watched Solomon Yue in action. To put it mildly, he is counter-productive, and he is surely no asset to Oregon. Solomon is a chameleon. He is now changing his advocacy from Mitt Romney and Romney‚Äôs friends to President Trump. Any less, would be fatal to his position. I have purchased and passed out thousands of President Trump campaign signs in Oregon and have always strongly supported both Senator Cruz and President Trump. The primary mission of the ORP is to aid the people of Oregon. The President‚Äôs actions are definitely helping Oregon. American freedom is being unconstitutionally attacked at the national, state, county, and local levels throughout our nation. The state and, where possible, county and local contests must be the ORP‚Äôs principle emphasis. Yet, consider the figure with which I began this article. Solomon Yue‚Äôs tenure as top officer and controller of the ORP has paralleled worse and worse Republican losses in the Oregon legislature and less and less ORP funding. We need a National Committeeman who works for Oregon. This is not coincidental. So long as Solomon Yue and his retainers control our state Republican Party, these losses can be expected to continue. This article is already long, but I could increase its length substantially by further specific descriptions of specific Republican losses in Oregon that have in significant part been the result of corruption and incompetence in the Oregon State Republican Party led by Solomon Yue. Some were also harmful to our nation. There are, of course, many very fine principled people in the ORP such as Treasurer John Lee, but they are overridden by Yue, Grossman, and their friends. The removal from office of Solomon Yue and the election of a principled replacement would go a long way toward a Republican resurgence in Oregon. John Lee would be an excellent choice. Art Robinson Former ORP Chairman P.S. I notice that the coming ORP meeting where the National Committeeman will be elected for the next 4-year term has been scheduled in a location especially near the homes of those Central Committee members who are expected to be more favorable to Solomon Yue. It is essential that all Central Committee members attend. The extra drive to the meeting may be your most important action in reviving the Oregon Republican Party. P.P.S. Solomon Yue has recently circulated a campaign email that presents an incorrect picture of his activities.  For examples: 1. Solomon represents that he has supported Donald Trump. Solomon was a very strong supporter of Mitt Romney because Romney is a part of the failed Republican establishment that Solomon has sought to please. Solomon used his ORP position to work vigorously against both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in 2016 in an effort to prevent the nomination of either one of these men. After Donald Trump was elected, Solomon has claimed to be a Trump supporter, but his work undermines the values that President Trump represents. 2. Solomon states that he supported Dennis Richardson. I worked very closely with Dennis in both his campaign for Governor and for Secretary of State. Solomon‚Äôs shenanigans and those of his retainers in both races were, in my opinion, significantly harmful to Dennis‚Äôs campaigns. 3. In his position as National Committeeman at the RNC, Solomon has supported statist policies that can significantly harm our nation, generally choosing sides based upon those which enhance his own career in politics. 4. Solomon states that he has effectively worked for increased ORP funding. The graphical figures above illustrate the non-effectiveness of his actions. 5. Solomon Yue seeks reelection every four years to a large extent on the basis of his activities within the national party taking place far from Oregon ‚Äì which are presented by him in a favorable way to benefit him. However, as our national committeeman, he has a responsibility to Oregon. The few fundraisers he has helped arrange are not worth the trouble he has caused the ORP. Since the ORP has constantly failed under his leadership, it is time for new leadership. Solomon is skilled at manipulating people. It is actually not difficult for one smart individual ‚Äì with plenty of money and time spend on it ‚Äì to make personal contact with enough ORP members to assure his reelection every 4 years. He works, himself and through his retainers, around the state to help elect members whom he thinks will be favorable to him and is often behind bylaws changes that will extend his tenure as well. Solomon works with detailed information about each individual voting ORP member specifying who needs to be contacted and what to say to each one. Most people who run for office in the ORP try to personally contact the Central Committee members or have friends contact members. Solomon and Grossman are masters at this, but this does not qualify them to control the ORP. Many people who have observed Solomon‚Äôs unprincipled actions over the years have speculated as to his motives. It is not necessary, however, to speculate. Solomon is a skilled political operative and should have been a benefit to the ORP, although Maoist tactics really do not belong inside the ORP at all. Instead, the ORP has constantly failed under his leadership. We need a new National Committeeman",2,,,,2,,,,1096183344064948,/story.php?story_fbid=1096183344064948&id=203008573382434

I believe in fair treatment of employees and in many cases this requires a collective bargaining position.  In so far as there is a BALANCE that is fair and equitable to all parties, I support Unions.  I take issue when a Union puts serious funds towards one political party.  Fundamentally I think those funds are better served to be used for the members of the Unions through college or trade school funds for their children.  If any monies are given to political elements then it should be representative of the Union body makeup.  So if 50% are Democrats, 40% are Republicans and 10% are Independents, then that is how political contributions should be distributed.  Fair is fair.  We see Democrats killing the trade industry jobs with their taxes, fees and excessive regulations.  Unions should reverse course in their support of such Socialist Ideologies.  I would be happy to speak with the various Unions, something we are working towards.  My first degree is a Bachelor of Science in Workforce Education and Development.

"Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for Congress, US Senator, Oregon",,2020-02-14 12:59:05,"Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon, provides the below statement on the sanctuary jurisdiction legal action announced today by Attorney General William P. Barr. ‚ÄúToday, Attorney General Barr announced new legal actions in several states being taken by the Justice Department to address sanctuary jurisdictions. I share the Attorney General‚Äôs belief that sanctuary status declarations directly contravene federal immigration law and threaten public safety. In our country, the Congress makes immigration law and has directed federal authorities to enforce it. The notion that states and other jurisdictions can interfere in the sharing of critical public safety information involving criminal conduct ignores the supremacy of federal law. Each year, many preventable crimes are committed when jurisdictions refuse to cooperate with lawful federal immigration enforcement activities. Oregon sheriffs and other law enforcement officers are caught in the middle of a highly politicized local and national debate over these policies. Many are left to choose whether to violate state or federal law. This is an untenable position for the men and women who work tirelessly to protect our communities. Since 2015, we have worked with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners here in Oregon to cure this impasse. Our work will continue tomorrow when we will again convene a large group of law enforcement partners to discuss these new lawsuits and other related issues.‚Äù",8,8,,,,,,1,1089179298098686,/story.php?story_fbid=1089179298098686&id=203008573382434

"Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for Congress, US Senator, Oregon",,2020-01-18 19:30:59,"Where do I stand on the LGBTQ curriculum in schools?  I do not support any kind of indoctrination for children in public schools in regard to ""alternative lifestyles"" or LGBTQ in any way.  (I also do not support the forced indoctrination of Islam in Public Schools.) Sex education was largely biology and reserved to the upper high school years.  We do not teach sex education to children in Pre-K, K-10.  I send my children to Public school to be educated and fully prepared for the world of work. (math, English, science, computer science, civics, home economics, geography, HISTORY, autoshop, wood products, etc.) When the LGBTQ ideology is put into public schools without the input and support of parents, this is a full on assault and violation of parental rights.  It's also an assault on our culture to push such things onto the shoulders of our children. In addition lifestyles are learned at home.  This bombardment by the MINISCULE representative element of those who would qualify to be members of LGBTQ needs to be shut down by those who are gay, bi, etc., who do not subscribe to this attack on the family unit through children.  I have friends who are gay and they are good neighbors who do not support the LGBTQ group as it is.  They work, live their lives, contribute to the community and don't infringe on anyone elses protected rights.  To read the LGBTQ manifesto years ago was shocking and beyond belief. IF you can still find it brace yourself.   I am a Christian.  I know that God sees all sins in the same light.  That's in your Bible, so walk carefully in any judgement. In that regard we are all equal in the eyes of God for our sin, that includes me.  The lives we live are between God and us as individuals.  He gave us all free will, even the teenagers (would like Him to revise that till 20 at least, that's a joke lol).  Our personal choices are ours to own and whether we seek true redemption for our choices or not, that remains our individual responsibility and NOT the responsibility of others.  Granted, we have laws of the people to keep good order and protect us, but not to force lifestyles or religious choices on a freedom and liberty driven people. At what point do they step up and force adults to learn of the perversions that they as adults don't even know???  It seems many of the people we put to protect and educate our children are effectively violating our children through such indoctrination and they are NOT educating them.  Don't believe me? Look at the greatly reduced school scores across this nation due to Common Core implementation and socialist indoctrination.  We have Socialist and Communists in America destroying the fabric of this great nation as they create chaos, division and undermine the family unit.  Totalitarianism is alive and growing in America and Oregon. It's all part of their plan and it's time for us all to fight back and recover that which makes us a great nation rather than continue this severe path of moral decay.  We should not fear our children attending Public school and we should not apologize for our Freedom and Liberty loving American Culture.  It's time for all Americans to pay attention and get involved in School Boards, City Council, local, state and federal govenment, because if we don't then we will experience the full effect of communism to ALL of our detriment.  I'm fighting this fight by running for US Senate and helping other candidates run for the State Legislature, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, and Congressional Districts.  We are at a major crossroads in our Oregon history.  Please help me help us all.  God bless you all, God bless Oregon and God bless America.",19,17,,2,,,,4,1068343246848958,/story.php?story_fbid=1068343246848958&id=203008573382434

It will take us all to win Oregon back from Socialist tyranny.  Get involved!Good morning Oregon Patriots.  I wanted to introduce myself and Dan Donahue  who are the admins on this page and let you know the reason behind us creating this platform.  We understand that there has been some ‚Äúinconsistencies‚Äù within our party, and Dan, with his extensive knowledge of politics decided that instead of letting Oregon burn to the ground, we would rise up and start a revolution.  His goal was to get a team of people together to run for legislative positions, and to unite those who already were running and create unity within our party.  His resources include training, support, the message, the knowledge, and the cohesion needed for our party to thrive.  We want every group from the medical freedoms, the 2a, the timber, the minors, the fishermen, the farmers, the Christians and anyone who is being taxed into oblivion by the socialist agenda to join forces to support those candidates with an R on the ballot, and who are fighting for your rights and freedoms. You will learn about their positions here and be able to ask them questions.  To all candidates: you have an open platform to post what you need to get your messages out, to post your events and to ask your voters questions, and they you. Please state your district. Voters, know your district and your candidates.  This group will be a working group. Meaning: we will not be posting articles that are not inherently related to Oregon policies, or Republican policies.  We would love for anyone to join, no matter what their party affiliation to learn what the Republican Party is about. Feel free to invite anyone into group you‚Äôd like.  We will need your collective ideas, brains and knowledge to get this done, so stay focused, stay engaged and stay ACTIVE. OREGON NEEDS YOU. People start turning off notifications for groups and get bored after a bit. I urge you not to, for the future if Oregon.  We will need two election cycles to turn Oregon around, so you‚Äôre in it for the long haul. Let‚Äôs make Oregon great again!!  Thank you! And welcome!!

These are the core elements of success. Such a joy and a pleasure to see such a grassroots and organic group perform such a public service with grace and courage. Never stop. Thank you so much ladies!!!So, I want to say just a few things about my experience at the Oregon State Fair. First of all...it was fun! 95% of the people that our booth encountered, were so nice and full of Trump love. The other 5%? Well, you know. They were mad, uninformed, and triggered. I am proud to say that all of us that worked the booth were kind, good listeners, yet strong and stood in support of our wonderful President. We were bold and unapologetic, as we should be. I was never more proud of this group. We had many people coming in to shake our hands, bring us water, take pictures with US, buy LOTS of Trump goodies, and wanted to know more on how to connect with such a wonderful group of people. It was encouraging to say the least. OWFT superceded our expectations on sales! We will be stocked up and ready for an even better OSF experience in 2020. One of the best parts of this fair was registering new Oregon Republican voters. President Trump needs these voters! We as a group, felt honored in helping make this possible. We lost track of how many #WALKAWAY voters we registered. We registered the young, old, and all kinds of different ethnicties. It was so awesome. One of the most common comments that was made is that ""We need to get President Trump to Oregon""! I agreed! But here is the deal...there has to be something in it for HIM to make that possible. Unfortunately, just a whole lot of Oregonians wanting him to come here will not be enough. He wants to see America First Candidates (such as Joey Nations For Congress, Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for US Senator, Oregon and Alek Skarlatos) being serious about running for office and working towards a win. We need to get on board with these candidates and help them win. This would help tremendously in getting President Trump to Oregon. The Oregon Republican Party needs to back these candidates as well. The infighting needs to stop and stop now, or we might as well kiss Oregon goodbye! Although OWFT is not a republican party group (yet MOST of us are indeed registered Rs), we will help with our grassroots efforts in getting the #bestPresidentever re-elected in 2020. That includes getting more and more people to get registered to vote. We cannot give up and not vote just because of P-town and Eug. They do not rule this state!! We CAN take this state back you guys! But, we all have to work together. OWFT is working towards this. Our next event is our upcoming trip to DC. There are about 30 of us going. The RNC is graciously working with us and is planning on some very special treatment for us. We will be posting more about this in the upcoming days to come. Lastly (I know this is long. Sorry), I want to thank all of you who supported, worked the fair, joined our group, added your Trump friends and family, hugged us, and offered up kind and encouraging words. It means so much to all of us Admins, whom do what we can to make Oregon Women for Trump 2020 (YOUR group) the best it can be.

"Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for Congress, US Senator, Oregon",,2019-07-02 20:02:06,"FRIENDS! CITIZENS! COUNTRYMEN!  LEND ME YOUR EARS!!!  Paul Joseph Romero, Jr. candidate speech for Republican Women for Oregon ~ Trump (due to some issues with the PA system and venue I wasn't quite able to cover what follows, but here it is for your review) START***  What makes America beautiful?  All of you certainly help, but what makes America stand out is that when things are at their worst, we are at our best.  Think about it.  Pearl Harbor, 9/11...these events brought us all together in a way that bridged great divides establishing the common ground necessary to overcome the worst.  And then, we forget that collaborative feeling and go our separate ways.  Catastrophe, a negative, brings us together and our focus falls away from what separates and divides us.  Well, here in Oregon we have been divided and now our catastrophe has arrived in full force.  Together, we will overcome it all with what makes us great! As for all of you, we as Americans have always assumed ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù.  There was no need to say it, suggest it, or speak out about it.  Sadly, that is no longer the reality.  Sadly, here in the State of Oregon, there is a war to kill our liberty, freedom and voice.  Sadly, they were winning as apathy spread over Oregon.  Sadly, I have to ask everyone I meet to step up and go to war to unify our State. The role you each will play could be simple or more taxing, but we all are needed, NOW.   Our party has eroded in numbers for the last 35 years and with good reason.  Leadership failure through compromises, corruption, and effectively giving up.  Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  President Reagan warned us about settling for pale pastels. The good news is that victory across the board is within our collective grasp.  Common ground has spread amongst all Oregonians by the very actions of those who oppress us all.  Too much too fast has compromised and exposed the real enemy of all Oregonians, notably their attacks on what made Oregon great. What makes us a great country? What makes America beautiful is also what makes America cry.  When things are at their worst, we are at our best.  The challenge, if you dare, is to regain what we hold dear and remain proactive to keep what is truly important here in America and Gods country.   Never apologize for the variety that makes up American culture.  It is, fundamentally, our strength! To begin, we must reach out to everyone.  Independents, Constitutionalists, non-Affiliated, Progressives, Liberals and Democrats.  But especially, Millennials.  Millenials who have been told they are all so  special and have been given participation trophies, have been let down by a socialist indoctrination.  Someone once said, ‚ÄúIf you are not Liberal at 20, you have no heart.  If you‚Äôre not  Conservative by 40, you have no brain.‚Äù  Granted, the definition of Liberal has been liberally changed to a point of being unrecognizable from the past, but all generations evolve through this.  I remember a time when MTV first came out and parents were certain it was the end of the world!  We turned out okay and so will the younger generations.  Don‚Äôt shut them out and don‚Äôt be over critical.  Help them find the courage to defend liberty and freedom. They will need courage to sit down and listen and the same courage to stand up and speak.  We need to let them know we understand, for we have been there.  We must show them the path with our combined morality, work ethic, devotion to family and country, and make sure they know there is nothing wrong with our American culture!  We are AMERICANS FIRST!    We are the envy of the world.  We aren‚Äôt perfect and there is always room for improvement, but not at the expense of our liberty or freedom. The first time someone suggested I run for office I stated I wasn‚Äôt a politician.  They responded that was one reason I should run.  People wanted someone who wasn‚Äôt a career politician and would step up!  January 2016, when I first announced I was running for CD2 people were angry.  They said I needed more experience.  They said I should run for the School Board, then City Council, Commissioner, etc.  I noted that it seemed they were actually looking for a career politician.  Then they suggested that once I turned 35 that I would have the experience in life I needed to run for such a position. Imagine the look on their faces when I politely informed them that I was about to turn 50 that year.  (I thank them for the unintended compliment.) We have a President, who is doing a great job even in the face of great opposition from both sides of the aisle, who was never elected to any office till now.  It would appear that putting the PEOPLE back in the PEOPLE‚ÄôS house is what is saving our country.  I would like to be your candidate of choice to serve you and help our President. I believe in wisdom, learning from the past or the experience of others to help my present and future.  Great words in our history have by and large been written and spoken.  It is up to us to remember and reapply them vigorously so that our national identity and culture survive and thrive. There is part of a speech by Theodore Roosevelt that has inspired me all my adult life. Mentioned to me by the greatest man and mentor I‚Äôve ever known, Donald Purkerson of Prineville, (he was a Marine, one of the Chosin Few of North Korean fame.)  It‚Äôs called ""Citizenship In A Republic"", delivered at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France on April 23rd, 1910.  If you get the chance to read the entire speech, I highly recommend it, but I‚Äôll warn you, it is pretty long but remains timeless. ""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."" Find your arena and go boldly knowing yours is not a cold and timid soul.  I have had my eye on the US House of Representatives representing CD2 and now in my new home in CD4, where I‚Äôm assisting a company to bring new jobs to Oregon.  However, last week I was asked to commit to something else and I accepted.   So today I am announcing my candidacy to run for the US Senate.  Why?  First, because I‚Äôm ready.  Second, you can‚Äôt represent people you don‚Äôt relate to.  So let‚Äôs see how we can relate.  I‚Äôm a father; a single father of 5 children, 3 biological and 2 foster children;  a 10 year Honorable Service Navy Veteran who has traveled the world; I‚Äôve chased jobs for the better part of the last 10 years; I‚Äôve been through the fiery hoops of death we all are privileged to because of out-of-touch politicians; I have shoveled snow, pig sties and horse stalls; bucked hay bales and changed pipe; hiked, hunted, camped and canoed all over Oregon; I‚Äôve cut wood in the Ochocos; I put myself through college earning a degree in Workforce Education & Development and work towards a double major in Mechanical Engineering & Mathematics.  (This all means that I know how to observe, analyze, locate the problem and fix it‚Ä¶..with my bare hands if necessary!!  I‚Äôm just a traveled, educated, intense Cajun, with a hint of Scottish warrior who grew up in Oregon).  We all come from somewhere but we all share in our love of GREEN Oregon and the America we grew up in‚Ä¶.simply, I am you, I am all of you.  So, here I am, along with other brave souls, and we‚Äôre about to throw ourselves into the arena with grim determination knowing that one person CAN make a difference.  BUT, I‚Äôm not just one.  I‚Äôm all of you and you are the source of my confidence.  My success will not be my own. It will be because of those who support my candidacy.  It will be because of the people I surround myself with to help me complete my service to Oregonians. It will be because of my direct responsibility to represent my fellow Oregonians.  To remain uncompromised and un-leverageable.  To be bold and outspoken in a Congress that has largely lost touch with the American voter.  I‚Äôm here and willing to fight for you.  I‚Äôm asking for your blessing, your support and your undying commitment to America first.   I am honored to have this opportunity to speak to you and with you.

"Paul Joseph Romero Jr. for Congress, US Senator, Oregon",,2019-02-18 13:59:07,There is another side to this coin. Consider the landlords who have been raking in record amounts on their rentals in Central Oregon and are not held to account by keeping those rentals within code. There's no policing of this and problems are rampant because landlords can legally get away with it. I'm not for rent control and I'm also not for antiquated State zoning laws. It's time for counties to nullify State zoning laws. This and holding landlords to reasonable code requirements make for a much better solution.,2,2,,,,,,,818935321789753,/story.php?story_fbid=818935321789753&id=203008573382434

Desperate Central Oregonians are having a hard time with excessive rent when median incomes remain at the poverty level. Supply and Demand??? Well, considering the stranglehold the State has on rezoning and the difficulty getting basic building permits or demolition permits...they don't want more affordable housing for those Oregonians.
