Hyatt For Senate,,2020-04-30 08:14:53,"Newton's law of motion: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. I think this law comes into play in economics also. Example: China is being punished for their part in the Covid19 pandemic. China, not wanting to lose money in lawsuits that have been filed against them, buys up as many of the meat processing plants as they can. China then uses the fear and panic created by the media here in the U.S. to shut down all their plants, causing farmers to take extreme actions and losses to get rid of their livestock. This in turn will cause a shortage of meat for consumers, which will in turn allow them to charge much higher prices for the products they turn out. They would be able to set the prices and the rate of production so they would gain the most profit.  Thankfully and hopefully it is not too late to stop this from happening. President Trump was on top of the situation and ordered the reopening of the processing plants. We can not allow China to have this kind of control over our economy. As your Senator I promise to put American interests first.",,,,,,,,,1850422965089002,/story.php?story_fbid=1850422965089002&id=1170922696372369

Hyatt For Senate,,2020-04-25 12:20:38,"It appears the stay at home order is only for Greater Minnesota. Traffic was backed up on the highway coming in to Baxter last night and was still busy this morning. Walmart parking lot was jam packed before 10:00 this morning. Grocery stores were busy as well. It was not local people!! It was people from the Metro Area coming up here bringing the Virus with them. Evidently the STAY AT HOME does not apply to them. They are here in large numbers and they don't care. On thier way home they will leave our stores empty of the products they are in short supply of in the Metro. If this is the way it is going to be then I say ""open every business that wants to open"" let's take thier money and and keep our economy alive.",5,5,,,,,,,1845819862215979,/story.php?story_fbid=1845819862215979&id=1170922696372369
Hyatt For Senate,,2020-04-21 21:10:01,"As a young boy growing up in the rural town of Long Prairie, my family attended the First Baptist Church on the corner of the block down the hill from the old water tower. This would have been about 1962. I remember going in the front doors where a man was pulling on the rope that rang the bell letting people in the community know services were about to start. If the call to prayer for the Muslim religion is so important, maybe instead of complaining about it, we should start remembering what made America great. It was our own faith in God and our Freedom to gather together to worship him. I would love to hear the bells ringing again and have people gathering together for worship and to pray for our nation and not just during these trying times.",6,5,,1,,,,,1842129965918302,/story.php?story_fbid=1842129965918302&id=1170922696372369
"Hyatt For Senate,Congressman Thomas Massie",,2020-04-21 07:35:59,"Virus bills should deal with only one topic at a time! The bill to fund testing should stand alone. The bill for small businesses should stand alone. The bill for state governments should stand alone. The bill for hospitals should stand alone. No OMNIBUS & no hidden pet projects! If something is so bad that you wouldn’t vote for it on its own, then you shouldn’t vote for it with other things added to it. This process that requires “all of the things or else none of the things” is just insane, and it’s failing the American people. One bill, one topic for all bills - isn’t that just common sense?",5,5,,,,,,,1841539429310689,/story.php?story_fbid=1841539429310689&id=1170922696372369
Hyatt For Senate,,2020-04-13 15:49:10,"Just what are our rights and where do we get them from? Let us start with the Pre-Amble to the Constitution of the State of Minnesota. We, the people of the state of Minnesota, grateful to God for our civil and religious liberty, and desiring to perpetuate its blessings and secure the same to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution. “Grateful to God for our civil and religious liberty”. The framers clearly, recognized God as the author and source of our liberties just as the writers of the Declaration of Independence did.  Our civil liberties; the right of freedom of speech, the press, the ability to peaceably assemble, to petition the government, along with no laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion, are all mentioned in amendment one of the Bill of Rights. The right of association (also from God) is found in the Declaration of Independence, (the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them). We can find a number of God given rights by observing nature. Nature’s God refers to our Creator (who is also mentioned in the Declaration of Independence).  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Article One  Sec. 16. Of the Minnesota Constitution: Freedom of conscience; no preference to be given to any religious establishment or mode of worship. The enumeration of rights in this constitution shall not deny or impair others retained by and inherent in the people. The right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience shall never be infringed…  nor shall any control of or interference with the rights of conscience be permitted… (excerpts). Those words like Never be infringed and no control or interference permitted are pretty self-evident as to what they mean .                                                                             Sec. 2. Of the Minnesota Constitution: Rights and privileges. No member of this state shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof… The rights to assemble, associate or do business with whom we chose, to own and operate our own business from which we derive income to take care of ourselves and our families have been infringed upon by the State. The rights mentioned above are without a doubt God-given, therefore cannot be infringed upon, suspended or taken away by any Man or Government for any reason. The main purpose of government is to secure our rights, not limit them. The Government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed and I, for one, do not consent. Forest W.

Hyatt For Senate,,2020-03-22 17:20:49,"I believe we are a Christian nation founded on Godly principles. Sometimes, God, whether it is in our own personal life, our family, neighborhood, town, state or country, has to bring us down to a level from which we can only look up. I believe as a Nation, such a time is upon us now. I believe for our leaders to call for a ""National Day of Prayer"" is insufficient. Vice President Pence often quotes: 2 Chronicles 7:14   If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Our founding fathers used the words ""with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence"". Benjamin Franklin at the Constitutional convention said: I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that ""except the Lord build, they labor in vain that build it."" I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a reproach and a bye word down to future age. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing Governments by Human Wisdom, and leave it to chance, war, and conquest. I truly believe it is time for Christians to call on God to intervene in this crisis. When this crisis is over, and it will be, to whom will we give the credit? Many will certainly find enough people to blame and some will be blamed even when no fault is there. If we fail to give honor where honor is due, surely the next hole we find ourselves in will be much deeper.  Starting today, let us pray without ceasing for his intervention, the healing of our people, for this country and its leaders.",4,4,,,,,,,1810944215703544,/story.php?story_fbid=1810944215703544&id=1170922696372369
