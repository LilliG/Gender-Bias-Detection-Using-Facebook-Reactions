"Ben Ray Luján,Barack Obama",Barack Obama,2019-02-07 23:11:02,"""John Dingell’s life reminds us that change does not always come with a flash, but instead with steady, determined effort."" I could not agree more, Barack Obama. John Dingell will be missed, but his legacy will live on.John Dingell’s life reminds us that change does not always come with a flash, but instead with steady, determined effort. Over the course of the longest congressional career in history, John led the charge on so much of the progress we take for granted today. He presided over the vote for Medicare – changing the lives of America’s seniors. He helped lead the fight for the Civil Rights Act – opening new doors for countless citizens. Ten years ago, in a moment of peril, he helped us rescue the American auto industry – saving the livelihoods of one million Americans. John sat beside me when I signed the Affordable Care Act – a law that nearly cut in half the uninsured rate in America. He had a long tradition of introducing legislation on the first day of each new Congress to guarantee health care for every single American. Because of him, we’ve come closer to that vision than ever before. And when we finally achieve it – and we will – we’ll all owe him our gratitude. Michelle and I send our warmest sympathies to Debbie, the entire Dingell family, and all the Michiganders and Americans whose lives are better because of his lifetime of service.",42,34,,7,,,1,1,10156389048092832,/story.php?story_fbid=10156389048092832&id=13063797831
