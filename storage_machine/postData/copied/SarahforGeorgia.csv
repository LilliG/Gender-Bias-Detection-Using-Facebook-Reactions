Sarah Riggs Amico,,2020-02-26 19:25:27,"Today is #AshWednesday, the first day of Lent for people in the Christian faith tradition.

Lenten fasting, meant to emulate Jesus' forty day fast in the desert, helps us remember that we have a purpose beyond our own interests.

This Lenten season, I'm honored that every day I get to meet Georgians ‚Äî from all faiths and backgrounds ‚Äî who are fighting against rising hate, division, and injustice.

Today is not cause for celebration. It is a sober lesson that corruption cannot and will not be tolerated in the United States.

Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-12-13 16:11:48,"‚Ä™‚ÄúBlack voters were 20% more likely to miss elections because of long distances.‚Äù‚Ä¨  ‚ÄúPrecinct closures and longer distances likely prevented an estimated 54,000 to 85,000 voters from casting ballots on Election Day last year, according to the AJC‚Äôs findings.‚Äù This is such an important issue. Please take a few minutes to read this stunning The Atlanta Journal-Constitution piece by Mark Niesse on the impact of precinct closures in GA with respect to minority voter turnout in the 2018 election.  As background: ‚Ä™The 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, a formula determining which states with a history of voting discrimination (including GA) required ‚Äúpre-clearance‚Äù of state/local voting procedures changes to prevent harm to minority voters. ‚Ä™The effects in Georgia have been chilling. ‚Ä™The AJC reported that from 2012 to 2018 ‚Äúcounty election officials shut down 8% of Georgia‚Äôs polling places and relocated nearly 40% of the state‚Äôs precincts.‚Äù‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™Most of these changes happened after the 2013 Shelby decision. ‚Ä™These changes disproportionately impacted minority voters in Georgia.‚Ä¨ From the article: ‚Ä™‚ÄúBlack voters were 20% more likely to miss elections because of long distances.‚Ä¨‚Äù ‚Ä™‚ÄúAbout 30% of black voters must now travel across half of their precinct to reach their poll compared to less than 20% of white voters.‚Äù ‚Ä™The AJC found that before the Shelby ruling, ‚Äúvoters of all races were barely affected by their distance to the polls, accounting for a 0.2% and 0.4% reduction in turnout‚Äù. ‚Ä¨ Between 2012 and 2018, that numbered quadrupled.  ‚Ä™In fact, the AJC‚Äôs independent statistical analysis found that ‚ÄúTurnout by black voters would have been between 1.3% and 2.1% higher on Election Day in 2018 if they all lived near their polling places.‚Äù This is one of the reasons voting rights and election security are core platforms of my US Senate campaign.  ‚Ä™ The Shelby decision struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which outlined the FORMULA used to determine the states & local jurisdictions that would be subject to the Voting Rights Act‚Äôs pre-clearance requirements.  However, Section 5 ‚Äî the section of the Voting Rights Act that provides for federal oversight of covered jurisdictions ‚Äî still stands.‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™The numbers in Georgia show that it‚Äôs time to restore the full protections for minority voters that were provided in the Voting Rights Act.  The good news is that Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives already are working to restore minority voter protections that were gutted by the Shelby v. Holder decision.  Now, we need a Democratic Senate that will take decisive action to strengthen voting rights & election security, so that all Americans have equal access to vote!  As a US Senator, I will make protecting the security of American elections a priority. And I will work tirelessly to protect your right ‚Äî the rights of every eligible voter ‚Äî to vote. https://t.co/PPJLF1ZrmU?amp=1",96,26,,,2,16,52,5,2913973678633101,/story.php?story_fbid=2913973678633101&id=1751850481512099

Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-09-24 18:01:11,"On July 25th, President Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Related to President Trump‚Äôs actions and behavior on that call, on August 12, an unnamed intelligence officer filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community Inspector General. The IC IG found the complaint credible and deemed the matter of ‚Äúurgent concern.‚Äù The contents of the whistleblower‚Äôs complaint have not yet been made public, nor have they been shared with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ‚Äî the first time a credible whistleblower complaint has ever been withheld from the Committee, according to its Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff. Publications including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, however, are reporting that during their call President Trump repeatedly asked President Zelensky to work with President Trump‚Äôs personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Despite initial denials, President Trump has now admitted he did discuss the former Vice President while speaking with President Zelensky. Further, President Trump has publicly acknowledged that he took actions to delay nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine ‚Äî and that he did so mere days before his July 25th call with President Zelensky. Military aid, appropriated by Congress from taxpayer money, is frequently used to bolster America‚Äôs alliances, protect national security interests, and promote global stability. If the whistleblower‚Äôs reported allegations are true, they are extremely serious. It is unlawful and immoral for the President of the United States to dangle foreign aid as a political bribe in exchange for investigating his political opponents. Jeopardizing American national security interests and using American influence for the personal benefit of the President is more than unacceptable ‚Äî it is the definition of corruption. The Inspector General should immediately release the full scope of the ‚Äòcredible and urgent‚Äô whistleblower complaint as well as all corroborating evidence.  Further, Senator David Perdue should publicly state whether he supports a full investigation of the whistleblower complaint, so that members of Congress can fulfill their Constitutional oversight and investigation duties. The Trump administration‚Äôs chronic abuse of power continues to test the limits of our democracy. It‚Äôs time for Congress to act. It‚Äôs time to begin impeachment proceedings. Our founding fathers established a system of checks and balances to hold power accountable: And that‚Äôs exactly what needs to happen. It‚Äôs the job Congress was elected to do, frankly it‚Äôs the job that Senator Perdue was elected to do, no matter the party affiliation. The American people deserve accountability.  As such, I support the House of Representatives' move to begin formal impeachment proceedings.",117,96,,20,1,,,7,2736845383012599,/story.php?story_fbid=2736845383012599&id=1751850481512099

Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-05-16 14:44:26,"I‚Äôm proud to announce my endorsement of Senator Senator Ron Wyden‚Äôs election security bill, the PAVE Act. This bill would ensure secure & accurate federal elections by requiring paper ballots, which would be subject to the voter‚Äôs verification before counting. https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-and-bicameral-coalition-introduce-bill-to-require-states-to-secure-elections-  The PAVE Act would prohibit the use of paperless machines, like those used in the 2018 elections here in #Georgia, where election security experts found deeply flawed vote counts that could have had a dramatic impact on the outcome of our election. In my race for Lt. Governor, we saw a suspiciously large drop off of almost 160,000 votes, although those voters did cast ballots for remaining down ballot races. As has been reported by multiple data security experts & news outlets, this is highly unusual (see this AJC piece: https://ajc.com/blog/politics/time-solve-the-mystery-the-100-000-missing-votes/nEYXrcGW8et8esyVL6W4QM/) Drop off among absentee voters (#HandMarkedPaperBallots) was normal in the 2018 #Georgia Lt. Governor‚Äôs race.  In other words, the suspiciously high voter drop off occurred ONLY on ballots cast via Georgia‚Äôs touchscreen, DRE voting machines, which have been deemed vulnerable by cyber security experts.  Data scientists determined 2018 voter drop off from Gov to Lt Gov was highly unusual vs. recent Georgia elections. Additionally suspicious: drop off was disproportionately high in Democratic-leaning counties & African-American precincts. (See this article from The Root: https://www.theroot.com/exclusive-thousands-of-black-votes-in-georgia-disappea-1832472558?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) Coincidence? What we do know is that, at a minimum, part of the blame falls on the notoriously faulty DRE voting machines and a flawed voting system. Experts and voters agree ‚Äî these machines have got to go.  As I‚Äôve said countless times, this isn‚Äôt just about the outcome of one election ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the integrity of ALL our elections. It‚Äôs about the trust and faith the American people should have that their fundamental right to vote is being protected. The portions of the Mueller Report that have been made available to the public shed additional light on this issue ‚Äî exposing the fact that in 2016, voting machines infrastructure in multiple states was hacked by foreign operatives with the intent of manipulating our elections. We can conclude that this is only the beginning, and that Russian cyberattacks on our #2020Elections are not only possible, but perhaps likely, if we do not take swift and dramatic action to counter their efforts and secure our votes.  Georgia Tech Professors Wenke Lee and Richard DeMillo have also endorsed the PAVE Act, even as their calls for #HandMarkedPaperBallots in Georgia have been willfully ignored by Governor Brian Kemp‚Äôs administration.  Brian Kemp (whose time as Secretary of State was rife w/accusations of voter suppression) denies the flaws of our voting systems. His Deputy Chief of Staff is a former lobbyist for ES&S, a voting machine company currently vying for a $150 million contract with the state of Georgia. (Press coverage: https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/firm-close-ties-georgia-stir-concerns-about-voting-system-purchase/HVK4wcNsEAKO0Xa0ptLLKM/) A recent expos√© by The New Yorker highlights the corrupt nature of the ties between voting machine lobbyists and political operatives, like Brian Kemp‚Äôs employees. You can read the expos√© here: https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-voting-machine-lobbyists-undermine-the-democratic-process The bottom line: We cannot trust our fundamental rights ‚Äî our very democracy ‚Äî to hackable, insecure, inaccurate voting machines whose makers are in bed with politicians for the sake of huge contracts that put profits (and political power) over people.  Congress must take action to ensure the security of our votes in advance of the #2020Elections. The PAVE Act is the solution; it will correct the vast deficiencies of flawed voting machines, which leave us vulnerable to foreign interference such as we witnessed in 2016.  American voters deserve to have voter-verified paper ballots, so they can have confidence that their votes will be counted safely, securely and accurately. Thats the America we deserve, and that‚Äôs the America Sen. Ron Wyden‚Äôs PAVE Act is going to ensure.  Having met with Senator Wyden about his efforts to secure our elections, and having discussed the ways the PAVE Act can do just that, I am proud to support it.",71,57,2,11,1,,,1,2487998884563918,/story.php?story_fbid=2487998884563918&id=1751850481512099
Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-05-09 18:57:10,"#TBT: In honor of #NursesAppreciationWeek, I‚Äôm sharing some photos of my beautiful mom as a neonatal #nurse, caring for some of the most vulnerable babies in NICU. Mom‚Äôs nursing experience helped shape my belief that every American has a right to affordable #healthcare. She also taught me that maternal health is critical to healthy families and children. In #Georgia, 79 of our 159 counties do not have an OB/GYN. Our state has the highest maternal mortality in America - a crisis that disproportionately affects African American women.  As the daughter of a former NICU nurse, I know that women, children and all Georgia families deserve better.",177,125,,51,,1,,8,2475111092519364,/story.php?story_fbid=2475111092519364&id=1751850481512099

Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-04-30 21:33:20,"The political dysfunction paralyzing Washington is actively harming Georgia workers and families, and we can‚Äôt allow it to go unchallenged. We deserve bold, inclusive policies that lift up and engage all communities across Georgia.  In the coming weeks, I‚Äôm going to be listening to Georgians from around the state to determine if I‚Äôm the candidate to drive that vision forward in Georgia‚Äôs 2020 election for the US Senate. I am truly grateful for the support and encouragement I have received as Andrea, the girls, and I, consider this remarkable opportunity to serve our state.  Finally, I want to thank Stacey Abrams for her leadership in the 2018 election. It was an honor to run alongside her last year as Stacey inspired voters across Georgia to turn out in record numbers. Our state needs that kind of bold leadership and I look forward to seeing the Democratic Party of Georgia build on that momentum in 2020.  The work Stacey has done - and is still doing at Fair Fight Action - will strengthen our state, our nation and our democracy for future generations. I am grateful for her work, her commitment to public service, and her friendship. #gapol https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/the-jolt-with-stacey-abrams-out-democratic-race-for-senate-begins/wvj79aJZpMmmBBAhomdZeK/",294,205,,89,,,,34,2459869444043529,/story.php?story_fbid=2459869444043529&id=1751850481512099

Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-04-27 08:53:32,"Sharing this thread on maternal mortality - which is shamefully high across the country (worst of the developed world) and in Georgia (which ranks 50/50 states in the metric üò¢). This crisis exposes vast racial inequity in our healthcare system: the risk of pregnancy-related death is 3-4 times higher for black women. If you have a story about Georgia‚Äôs maternal health crisis, please share it below or send me a message. These stories deserve to be heard.  During our campaign last year, I spoke often about the lack of access to pre-/post-natal care for women in the 79 counties without an OB/GYN and women who lack insurance (the problem so disturbed me that we included Georgia‚Äôs maternal health crisis in our general election commercial).  It‚Äôs critical that we engage on this issue and turn up the pressure for our state to cure what has become a crisis in maternal health. Our leader must take action; it‚Äôs literally a matter of life and death. https://twitter.com/sarahriggsamico/status/1122110380455682050?s=21",38,27,,,,8,3,,2453836337980173,/story.php?story_fbid=2453836337980173&id=1751850481512099

We join people around the world in praying for the people of Sri Lanka, the victims of these vicious attacks, and their loved ones.

Tonight, I am particularly grateful for the blessed assurance of Easter. To all who celebrated, I hope Easter brought you joy.

Sarah Riggs Amico,,2019-04-21 16:31:46,"My heart aches. Today, on Easter, we see houses of worship are yet again targets of terror. No one should fear for their life in the place where they worship their Creator - whether that‚Äôs churches in Sri Lanka, a synagogue in Pennsylvania, mosques in New Zealand, or a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.  The high cost of hate is too often paid by the innocent. People of good conscience from all walks of life must be unequivocal - and vocal - in condemning these vicious attacks.
