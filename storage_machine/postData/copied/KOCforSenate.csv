I hope this message finds you well, safe, healthy and that you and yours remain healthy. As you may know I am running for re-election to continue to serve as your State Representative.  Notwithstanding our need to social distance, I still need to present 150 certified signatures in order to qualify for the 2020 election ballot this Fall. The usual means of collecting signatures such as, door to door, outside post offices and supermarkets and during town elections don‚Äôt work this year due to our need to social distance. With help, I have been able to drop nomination papers and return envelopes at doorsteps and have mailed papers and return envelopes to people who have requested them. I am so grateful and humbled by the number of people who have reached out, signed and returned my nomination papers and others who have, even with social distancing been able to collect signatures and return nomination papers to me. As successful as we have been we still need more signatures before the end of the month.  Let me know if I can mail to or leave nomination papers for you by private messaging me.   Also if you are driving or walking near 79 Walker Lane, Abington MA, I will have a table set up today, with nomination papers for Abington, East Bridgewater, and Whitman.  The table will include new pens and hand sanitizer. These are extraordinary times.  Many people and families are struggling.  We must all do our part to help.  As challenging as it is, social distancing has slowed down the spread and has helped save lives.  I am grateful for all those that are helping and treating the inflicted, that continue to protect our safety and well being and our first responders. I am reminded, especially this week, that we will prevail, we will soon return to normalcy and we will re-celebrate all those important events we have missed with family and friends.

I hope this message finds you well, safe, healthy and that you and yours remain healthy. As you may know I am running for re-election to continue to serve as your State Representative.  Notwithstanding our need to social distance, I still need to present 150 certified signatures in order to qualify for the 2020 election ballot this Fall. The usual means of collecting signatures such as, door to door, outside post offices and supermarkets and during town elections don‚Äôt work this year due to our need to social distance. With help, I have been able to drop nomination papers and return envelopes at doorsteps and have mailed papers and return envelopes to people who have requested them. I am so grateful and humbled by the number of people who have reached out, signed and returned my nomination papers and others who have, even with social distancing been able to collect signatures and return nomination papers to me. As successful as we have been we still need more signatures before the end of the month.  Let me know if I can mail to or leave nomination papers for you by private messaging me.   Also if you are driving or walking near 79 Walker Lane, Abington MA, I will have a table set up today, with nomination papers for Abington, East Bridgewater, and Whitman.  The table will include new pens and hand sanitizer. These are extraordinary times.  Many people and families are struggling.  We must all do our part to help.  As challenging as it is, social distancing has slowed down the spread and has helped save lives.  I am grateful for all those that are helping and treating the inflicted, that continue to protect our safety and well being and our first responders. I am reminded, especially this week, that we will prevail, we will soon return to normalcy and we will re-celebrate all those important events we have missed with family and friends.
