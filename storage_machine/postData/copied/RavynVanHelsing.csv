I'm not doing traditional fundraising, it is impossible for me to compete with Collins financially. Please take anything you planned to give and donate it to a local school library, classroom, or scholarship program of some sort. Put your money to use in the same way I plan to help the future of our state and our nation when I win, by supporting our future generations.",8,6,,2,,,,,619691298434731,/story.php?story_fbid=619691298434731&id=223264221410776

Danielle Ravyn VanHelsing,,2019-04-23 06:25:01,"As I wait for the supreme court to rule on my rights to not be discriminated against in the workplace I think of how far humanity could have come. We could be living in a time where everyone is treated equally as human beings but we must still fight over who deserves basic human rights, essentially deciding if someone is as human as everyone else. This is a sad and dangerous mentality. No one person has any greater value than any other. These futile attempts to take rights from others will be changed with time, as they always are, and are simply wasting valuable resources that could be used to accomplish great things as a species. Humanity spends far too much time on the trivial fact of life, easily distracted from those things which matter. We are better than this, let us hope the supreme court can see that.",3,3,,,,,,3,547663905637471,/story.php?story_fbid=547663905637471&id=223264221410776

Sustainable agriculture, alternative energy usage, transitioning to electric cars and providing charging stations across the state and the nation.

We need to start to turn the unused spaces in our cities into green spaces to power our lives and clean up the air. Assist in home repair and renovation project to improve energy usage in homes and reduce the ecological impact of poorly maintained and older homes, this also to improve the lives of those living in those situations.

Thinking it would pass, I went home to try and rest for the night. A bit later I vomited. I thought that was the end of it.  But for the rest of the night, I kept vomiting almost every 30-40 minutes. Even after my stomach was completely empty, I kept vomiting. Soon it was nothing but stomach fluid and bile. I tried to drink water to stay hydrated, but I kept throwing it up, no matter how hard I tried to keep it down.  By 3am I had severe stomach cramps, my body kept trying to vomit even though there was nothing left. I was dizzy and light-headed. My symptoms showed no signs of abating.  At this point I had to seek medical treatment, I knew I had to go to the hospital.  I wanted to avoid it. I had no idea how different Taiwanese hospitals would be, whether I would be able to find an English speaking doctor, or what it would cost me (my US health insurance has lapsed and I don't qualify for Taiwanese NHI).  My Taiwanese roommate called a taxi and took me to the ER at NTU Hospital. I was immediately checked-in by an English speaking nurse. Within 20 minutes I was given IV fluids and anti-emetics. They took blood tests and did an ultrasound to ensure it wasn't gall stones or appendicitis. From there I was given a diagnosis: a particularly severe case of Acute Viral Gastroenteritis (aka the stomach flu). After about 3 hours on an IV, I began to feel slightly better, my nausea disappeared and my stomach began to calm down. I was discharged with a prescription for anti-emetics and pain medication. Each day since Ive gotten progressively better and am now pretty much back to normal.  The bill for the ER visit?...  US$80.00  Eighty. American. Dollars. Out of pocket. Full cost. No discounts. No insurance.  At one of the best hospitals in Taiwan.  And if I had NHI, it would have been a fraction of that.  This could have easily cost me hundreds or even thousands in the US without insurance. But here in Taiwan I was able to receive speedy, quality care comparable to what I would have gotten in a US hospital for relatively small amount of money.  Given this experience, I no longer have a reason to fear or hesitate getting care in Taiwan should I ever need it.  America, it's time to stop making excuses.",5,5,,,,,,,520878348316027,/story.php?story_fbid=520878348316027&id=223264221410776

Danielle Ravyn VanHelsing,,2019-01-25 21:20:17,"Some of my platforms for those interested. Jobs: My biggest focus for job growth in Maine has always been the infrastructure. Most of Maine still has dialup, if internet at all. The portions with high-speed internet are subpar compared to other states. This hinders the ability for Maine businesses to compete in the market and certainly, with spotty cell service, bad roads, and crumbling bridges, businesses are not interested in coming here thus stunting job growth options and causing the state to stagnate and fall behind the rest of the country. If we fix our entire infrastructure we provide a space that businesses will be attracted to and willing to invest in. Education: My big focus for education in Maine is to ensure all public schools have adequate funding across the state and that higher education is more affordable and accessible for everyone. One of the biggest drains on the state job market stems from out of state colleges being more affordable and drawing people out of the state, that combined with better job opportunities people tend to choose not to return. This goes hand in hand with my plans for the job market in Maine above. Healthcare: Healthcare is a human right and no one deserves to remain sick and/or die as a result of the cost of medicine and medical care. Everyone has a right to a happy and healthy life. I will work to ensure this is the case for everyone in the state of Maine.",15,11,,4,,,,3,506871859716676,/story.php?story_fbid=506871859716676&id=223264221410776
