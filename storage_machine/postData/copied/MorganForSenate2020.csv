Wesley Morgan,,2020-03-04 13:03:28,"This is an absolute violation of the rules of the Republican Party of Kentucky. The RPK is prohibited from endorsing a candidate in a Primary race. Has our Party become so bias for McConnell that they will blatantly violate their rules in plain site of their members. RPK you should shut this down immediately before it becomes obvious of their open support for McConnell. The party is no longer a Party of rank and file Republicans. But actually a party for the benefit of Mitch McConnell. Conservatives you should rebel against their party. This is no different than Hillary Clinton rigging the election against Bernie Sanders in 2016.

Where was McConnell then? McConnell's voting record discloses he has been for abortion throughout much of his Senate tenure! 1989—McConnell voted for Federal funds for abortions in 1989. [RC #252]  1991—Pro-Abortion Vote: McConnell voted for $25 billion in foreign aid that also overturned the administration’s ban on using U.S. dollars to promote abortions. [RC #219, 1991]  1992—Pro-Abortion Vote: McConnell voted to allow abortion counseling at federally funded family planning clinics. When President Bush vetoed the bill, he overrode the President’s veto. [RC #254, 1992]  2017-18—McConnell refused to pass a 20-week abortion ban even though Republicans controlled all branches of the Federal government. When Rand Paul attempted to pass legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, McConnell had a talk with him and explained they did not want pro-life legislation to pass. According to Rand Paul, “Last year, I tried to attach to a spending bill a prohibition to have any money spent by Planned Parenthood. You know what happened?

"Wesley Morgan,Wesley Morgan",Wesley Morgan,2020-02-14 17:54:33,"Mitch McConnell is not a conservative. In fact, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW gives Rand Paul 92% grade on Conservatism, but they only give McConnell a grade of 36%. Mitch McConnell is very unpopular in Kentucky. He has a 50% approval rating with the Republican Party but only a 33% approval rating for the entire state. McConnell, while our Kentucky U. S Senator, has undermined our constitutional rights; 1) By voting, while Senate Minority Leader, for the repeal the Smith Mundt Act, that prohibited the use of government propaganda in the American News media. 2) By slipping into the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act H. R 5181, Countering Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda Act, which created a slush fund to be used to censor conservative content in social media platforms, and 3) By refusing to allow President Trump to fill his vacancies, including conservative Judges, through “Recess Appointments”. McConnell has made sure the Senate did not officially recess by leaving someone to gavel in and gavel out while all the Senators were actually in recess. Harry Reid allowed President Obama to fill all his appointments with “Recess Appointments”. 4) By voting to confirm Ruth Bader Ginsburg and other liberals to the U. S Supreme Court, Ginsburg being the most liberal Supreme Court Justice probably in history 5) By voting in 2014 to disenfranchise the average voter by increasing the campaign finance limit to parties or committees of parties, not individual candidates from a maximum of $32,400 to $324, 000, which created “Dark Money” and allowed very rich persons to control who is elected to Congress. 6) By voting against the 2nd Amendment 6 times. 7) By voting 4 times to fund abortion 8) By voting against the 4th Amendment by making the Patriot Act permanent, which authorizes unprecedented surveillance powers to the Federal government. And he has stated the Patriot Act is “one of the most important and overdue pieces of legislation in a generation” and declared “it didn’t go far enough”. Even though this act allows for U. S Citizens to be declared domestic terrorists and detained indefinitely. 9) By voting for North American Free Trade Act, Central American Free Trade Act and World Trade Organization which has gutted this country of millions of jobs. 10)By voting for a 700 billion bailout of Wallstreet and he declared “the senate     at its finest”                                                                                                                                 11) By voting against an audit of the FED, an organization that is not Federal but a group of unelected bankers who issue our money and charge us interest.       12)By voting for the 2001 “No Child left behind Act” which created unprecedented Federal involvement in Education.       13) By voting in 2013 to end debate and allow Harry Reed to fund Obamacare on a strictly party vote 14) By voting in 2011 and 2012 to not allow American’s access to low cost prescription drugs from Canada. 15) By voting for the Clean Air Act that killed coal production in Kentucky",6,5,,,,1,,,2588578104720318,/story.php?story_fbid=2588578104720318&id=2365214577056673

Wright",2020-02-03 08:55:56,"Some very good questions?????Things that make you go...HMMMMM. Hat tip to Archie Paul THE UNANSWERED MYSTERY OF THE CENTURY!!! ~ BHO ~ His 8 years of living in the White House is over. He’s (mostly) gone ... but questions remain. This came from a union guy in Chicago who didn't vote for Obama. A very interesting perspective! It will be interesting to see what they put in his ""Library"" about his early years now that he is out of office. In a country where we take notice of many, many facets of our public figures' lives, doesn't it seem odd that there's so little we know about Barack Obama? As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single humanizing fact about the history of our own ex-president. We are all aware of the lack of incontestable birth records for Obama; that “document managing"" has been spectacularly successful. There are, however, several additional oddities in Obama's history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue. One other interesting thing... There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found? It's interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up. The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign, certainly would in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all know about JFK's magnetism, that McCain was no monk and quite a few details about Palin's courtship and even her athletic prowess, Joe Biden's aneurysms are no secret; look at Cheney and Clinton, we all know about their heart problems. Certainly, Wild Bill Clinton's exploits before and during his White House years were well known. That's why it's so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, ""He was soooo shy..."" or ""What a great dancer.."" It's virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow. Who was the best man at his wedding? Start there. Then check groomsmen. To get the footage of the graduation ceremony. Has anyone talked to the professors? It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him. When did he meet Michele, and how? Are there photos there? Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc. for their library, etc. What has he released? And who voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010? Doesn't this make you wonder? Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obama's past saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc?? Not one person has ever come forward from his past. It certainly is very, very strange.. This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man. Have you seen a movie named ""The Manchurian Candidate""? As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face; someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about us. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questions why no one has acknowledged he was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia -- the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him. He is such a great orator; why doesn't anyone in Obama's college class remember him? Why won't he allow Columbia to release his records? Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University. Looking for evidence of Obama's past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there... but none remembered him. Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama, ""I don't know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever."" Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of '83 Political Science, and says, ""You don't get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don't know anyone who ever met him. At the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who's kind of the, as we say in New York, 'the macha' who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him."" Obama's photograph does not appear in the school's yearbooks and Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia. Some other interesting questions: 1. Why was Obama's law license inactivated in 2002? It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam. 2. Why was Michelle's law license inactivated by court order? We understand that it was forced to avoid fraud charges It is circulating that according to the U.S Census, there is only one Barack Obama but 27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias' are connected to him. The Social Security number he uses now originated in Connecticut where he is reported to have never lived. And was originally registered to another man (Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut, who died in Hawaii while on vacation there. As we all know Social Security Numbers are only issued 'once, they are not reused. No wonder all his records are sealed... Please continue sending this out. Somewhere, someone has to know SOMETHING, before he reorganized Chicago?. SOMETHING!!! He just seemed to burst upon the scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention. ANYONE??? - ANYWHERE??? - ANYTHING??? I think soon much is going to come to light about this highly unqualified person who was President of the United States for 8 years. Soon, we will know how badly we were all doped and duped by this impostor who has basically, with much help from his minions, almost brought the greatest nation in history to its knees in ruins. That will be his legacy. He totally destroyed the Integrity, morals and Christian heritage of our once great country. But, WHO THE HELL IS HE? ? ?",15,9,,1,1,1,3,2,2579124255665703,/story.php?story_fbid=2579124255665703&id=2365214577056673

"Wesley Morgan,Wesley Morgan",Wesley Morgan,2020-01-30 10:03:57,"I am posting here an article written by Scott Sheldon. I am only posting the parts of this article concerning Elaine Chao. There were other parts of this article that made references to President Trump. I deleted those comments. I believe the President has been held hostage by Mitch McConnell. McConnell as Senate Majority Leader has held the constant threat of impeachment over the President's head. McConnell I believe wanted Chao appointed as Secretary of Transportation. If the President said ""no"" then the President would have been at McConnell's mercy when it came to impeachment. The President has never endorsed McConnell, he has only said ""Mitch is a very powerful man"". That says volumes. Anyway, below is the research Sheldon done on Elaine Chao; ---------------Who Is Elaine Chao--------------- ---------------You Need To Know--------------- Secretary of Transportation – Elaine L. Chao – CFR, Let’s meet Trump's Secretary of Transportation: Elaine Chao – She is a CFR member Elite Puppet, say what, how dare you say such a fact. I know I am talking like a liberal now as some of you will say!! Well, anyway here we go!! Picked by Trump to be the current Secretary of Transportation. I knew she was a CFR member but I just couldn’t figure out what she wanted the job for and/or what benefit it would be to the World Elites. Well, first let’s look back at some of her history. She was also a former Labor Secretary under Bush. She has a long history in Washington and Elaine Chao made history as the first woman of Asian descent in a presidential Cabinet when she became President George W. Bush's labor secretary from 2001 to 2009, and as Deputy Secretary of Transportation and Director of the Peace Corps under President George H. W. Bush. She also served on the board of directors for Shueisha. She has also been CEO of the United Way. Chao, who comes from a wealthy shipping family, immigrated to the US from Taiwan at 8. Before her work in government. Chao was vice president for syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group in San Francisco and an international banker at Citicorp in New York. She is also one half of one of the most powerful couples in Washington; her husband is the scumbag greedy traitor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Chao had gold-colored coins minted with her name in bas-relief and employed a staff member who carried around her bag. To top that off with a cherry she asked John Huang to give money to her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. I wonder what kind of favors were supposed to be traded for that? Remember Huang? Huang worked for Lippo Bank in California and Worthen Bank in Arkansas. He was also a deputy assistant secretary for international economic affairs in Bill Clinton’s Commerce Department before he became a chief fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in 1996. In 1999, he plead guilty to a felony conspiracy charge for violating campaign finance laws and was sentenced to one year of probation. Also he was implicated in the highly sensitive top secret missile technology swap handed to him by Bill Clinton and in turn given to the Communist Chinese government in exchange for lots of cash and later access for top Chinese officials into the White House! Here we go Trump the leverage specialist already in action to be in great positions to make tons of cash if he chooses!! Someone once stated that “hey, Elaine comes from a family of achievers!! Well yes. high achievers and now since Elaine wanted the job when she met with Trump at the Trump towers way back in 2016 and she was then picked as the Secretary of Transportation and that department also controls the bureaucracy of the Merchant Marines and MORAD and guess what? Coincidently father James Chao and the family, including Elaine own a huge Merchant shipping fleet so then I guess they will now be achieving a lot more into their pockets!! Elaine used to also work with the family company the ""Foremost Group"". And who are the executives of the company? Well, father James is the founder and Chairman and Elaine's sister, Angela, is the Vice Chairman and Elaine's other sister, Christine is General Counsel of the ""Foremost Group"". Working in a government position used to be called a conflict of interest. OH, and one more thing before I forget. Let’s not forget that the world Elites and world Bankers have huge investments in Merchant Shipping as well so I wonder is there a connection there or is that just another coincidence? And here is some more achievements of the Chao family and in-laws. Elaine and her husband Mitch McConnell and Elaine's sister Angel and her Billionaire Husband Jim Breyer are all 4 members of the Council on Foreign Relations. You know, that same CFR where various members including their president have stated their desire to see that America ends as a sovereign Nation!!! The same organization that was founded by the world Banking Cartel and who are also the same group who founded the evil Federal Reserve which is robbing and raping our nation to the bone!! Now that's some real achievements, for their Elite bosses and friends and for their plans for a New World Order, isn't it??",3,2,,,,1,,,2575797529331709,/story.php?story_fbid=2575797529331709&id=2365214577056673

WHAT A JOKE! Freshman Senator Josh Hawley, Missouri has introduced a formal Senate Resolution that states.""If Democrats do not deliver their Articles of Impeachment to the  U. S Senate, as required by the constitution. He will introduce a Senate Resolution to Allow Dismissal of "" their Bogus Impeachment"". The Resolution gives the Democrat's 25 days to introduce the impeachment and if they don't he will introduce a Resolution to dismiss.  Why would it take a freshman Republican Senator to introduce a Resolution to dismiss the ""Articles of Impeachment""? Why would McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, not have stepped up and introduced this Resolution? Because McConnell is a Deep State Globalist who is not protecting President Trump, but instead is trying to use the impeachment as a tool for re-election. McConnell is a ""Never Trumper"" and wants President Trump gone as bad as the democrats. All you got to do, is look at the McConnell's connections to the Red Chinese! Is their connection to millions of dollars from China any different than the millions of dollars from China to the Joe Biden family?

Our country is more than 22  trillion dollars in debt.  The Supreme Court makes new laws out of  thin air. The President makes new laws with  the stroke of a pen. Federal bureaucracies  pound American businesses and workers at  every turn. Day by day, law by law, regulation by  regulation, the federal government  encroaches on States’ rights and our  individual rights as citizens. We all  see it happening. Our children’s future  is being sold down the river by D.C.  politicians and bureaucrats who want to  hand out Political favors and turn the  bill over to future generations. We all know it's happening, whether we are  Democrats or Republicans.  We are all AMERICANS FIRST. So what can we  do about it? COSA  Kentucky Needs You  !!! Convention of States Kentucky is made up of  regular, everyday citizens (22,000 +) building a  grassroots movement right here in Kentucky  to encourage our Legislators in Frankfort to  pass our resolution to call for an Article V  Convention of States. As Article V of our Constitution states,  “when the Legislatures of two thirds of the  States send an application to congress, the  congress shall call a Convention of the States  for the purpose of proposing amendments.”  Many of our Kentucky legislators are on board  with this idea of returning power back to the  States as established in our Constitution, but  many still need to hear from the Citizens of  Kentucky. You can become active on any  level that you choose with the Convention of  States. You can SIGN OUR PETITION.  The petition simply asks your Legislator to  support our Kentucky resolution to call for a  convention.  If you would like to Volunteer, you  can do it on a level that fits in with your  schedule and your time constraints. We need  volunteers to send emails to their Legislator  or to sit down for 10 minutes to write a Personal letter to your Representatives. We need folks who will call the office of your  Legislator or visit your Legislator’s local office.   We need help in working with the media to spread  the COS word.  As a growing grassroots organization we need YOU  to help us as we stand for OUR RIGHTS AS CITIZENS,  for Kentucky’s rights as a sovereign state and  for the future of our children. Kentucky will stand, but she will not stand alone.  Convention of States is organized in all 50 states.  The Convention of States resolutions have already  passed in 15 states: Alaska, Florida, Georgia,  Alabama, Tennessee, Indiana, Oklahoma, Louisiana,  Arizona, North Dakota, Texas, Missouri, Utha, Arkansas and Mississippi. we are one third of  the way there. Legislation is being introduced in as many as 30  other states this year. Concerned Americans are  signing up and Volunteering in every state to stand  against an overreaching federal government.

"Wesley Morgan,Wesley Morgan",Wesley Morgan,2019-12-28 09:44:03,"Mitch McConnell is a Deep State creature. The Deep State is aiding and abetting him in their attempt to silence me. I am being shadow banned and blocked at every turn on social media and even my emails continued to be rejected by email providers. When I filed with the Secretary of State on December 17, 2019, to run for U. S Senate, not one member of the news media showed up for the event. I called a reporter from the Lexington Herald Leader and ask him why he had not attended. Especially since he had told me that morning he would be there. He told me I had been instructed by his supervisor not to attend. But look how the media endorses McConnell and never fails to miss an opportunity to cover Democrat Amy McGrath. This is true even though McGrath has never been elected to anything. I am a former Kentucky State Representative. All of this is true, even thought I filed with th Federal Election Commission to run for U. S Senator on May 16, 2019. The only press I eventually got was a social media piece by WLEX. And their reporting stated that another person files to run against McConnell. They didn't say I had been running since May 16, 2019. The other candidates had not filed with the FEC at all or had very recently filed. The truth is plain, the media, mainstream or social is OK with liberal McConnell or democrat McGrath. But God forbid a Constitutional Conservative who believes in God, the Constitution and the sovereignty of the United States be allowed to win a U. S Senate seat. WAKE UP KENTUCKY!! We are being treated like sheep being led to the slaughter house. Please help get the word out. People fall for him pretending to be a constitutional conservative when he runs for re-election. They fail to hold him accountable for the last thirty five years of voting against constitutional principles. Believe me, if he wins re-election he will become President Trumps worse nightmare. Corruption is on both sides of the isle. McConnell will do everything to cover up how he and Elaine have made millions from Red China. Now he acts like he is our savior concerning conservative Judges. But in fact, where were the conservative Judges before re-election year. We are three years into President Trump's term and we are just now getting these Judges. Shame on people for falling for this scam. Go to morganforsenate2020.com and read McConnell's voting record. You will be SHOCKED! It takes patriots like you to share our posts and messages with everyone you can. As I stated above the social and mainstream media is not going to allow the public to know I am running. It must be a grass roots effort. So please like and share as often as you can and in every way you can. When I speak to various organizations and groups, most of them are appalled, when I reveal McConnell's voting record. But one good thing, most already aware of McConnell's record and are feed up with him. Except, McConnell supporters who constantly interrupt me or make unfounded allegations.

He is only a friend to conservative Kentuckians (and Trump) when re-election year rolls around. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a fight for our freedom like never before. We have lifelong politicians, like Mitch McConnell, who have made themselves rich and passed legislation that provides them with generous healthcare and retirement benefits. Meanwhile, hardworking and struggling taxpayers only get the scraps that McConnell and other corrupt politicians throw to them. I, for one, will not tolerate it any longer! And, unlike many, I am not scared of Mitch McConnell. Special thanks to Bernie Kunkel, of Boone County, and Sam Welch, of Johnson County, for signing as my witnesses. Also thank you to my many friends and supporters who were either present or encouraging me from home. Your faith in me will not be forgotten. And, of course, thank you to my family for their unconditional love and support. For more information on my background, platform, and how you can help me (and Trump) drain the swamp, please visit morganforsenate2020.com. I realize that Mitch McConnell and his team will do their best to attack me and smear my name as much as possible over the next few months. To that I say: Bring it on, Mitch. You can rely on your lies, I’ll rely on your record. Now tell me, which of us should be afraid?",74,66,,8,,,,17,2532978776946918,/story.php?story_fbid=2532978776946918&id=2365214577056673

Wesley Morgan,,2019-12-15 23:27:30,"Fellow Kentuckians, I will be in Frankfort this Tuesday to officially file as a candidate for U.S Senate in the 2020 Republican primary with the Kentucky Secretary of State’s office. After the filing I will be conducting a news conference in the Rotunda at the State Capitol Building at 1:00 pm EST to answer questions concerning my candidacy. My opponent, Mitch McConnell, has been in office far too long (35 years) and is out of touch with Kentuckians because he answers only to his out of state big dollar corporate donors, lobbyists and special interest groups. If you believe, like I do, that Kentuckians deserve a (real) Constitutional Conservative who will work for them and someone that President Trump can trust to fully support him against the “Do-Nothing” Socialist Democrats and their impeachment sham;  please join me on Tuesday at 1:00 PM at the State Capitol Rotunda (700 Capital Ave, Frankfort, KY 40601) to show your support. “Mitch McConnell’s going to go to the wire, because he is vehement about not standing for anything. And he has a good long track record about not standing for much other than keeping the campaign dollars flowing. And that is not inspiring to ordinary Americans, to conservatives, even to base Republicans.” - Ken Cuccinelli, Principal Deputy Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency and Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security [In an interview with The Hill 10-19-2014] For more information, please visit my website at http://morganforsenate2020.com/  or my Facebook page: Wesley Morgan https://www.facebook.com/MorganForSenate2020/ Also, if you would like to contact me you can email at Wesley.morgan@lwky.net or call me at 859-661-2710.

Morgan Bills.xlsx To the Kentucky News Media, I am calling a news conference at the Capitol Rotunda, State Capitol Building, Frankfort, Kentucky for Tuesday, December 17, 2019, at 1:00 PM.  At that time, I will file with the Kentucky Secretary of State as a candidate for U. S Senate, in the May 19, 2020 Republican Primary.  After filing, I will proceed to the Capitol Rotunda, where I will make a statement concerning my candidacy and answer any questions the news media may have. I have attached to this email 1) a list of all bills I sponsored or co-sponsored while I was a Kentucky State Representative for House District 81 during 2017 and 2018 2) an Op-Ed I wrote in June 2019 along with assistance from my daughter Jordan Morgan and Virgil Edwards and 3) Mitch McConnell’s voting record while he has been a Kentucky U. S Senator. I strongly urge you to review this information, especially the voting record of McConnell, I think you will be shocked! In addition,  please pay particular attention to these four things; 1) The Smith Mundt Modernization Act which McConnell and Harry Reed slipped into the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, 2) H.R 5181, The Countering Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda Act, which McConnell slipped into the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, 3) The 2014 Congressional Spending bill, where McConnell increased the amount of a campaign contribution from $32,400 to $324,000 to political parties or committees of political parties, not individual candidates. This is known as “Dark Money” and is used to disenfranchise the voters and, 4) The fact that McConnell refused to recess the Senate in August 2019, that prevented President Trump from making any “Recess Appointments”, that would have allowed the President to fill all his appointments through 2020. Then McConnell campaigns that he must be reelected in order to get these conservative nominees confirmed by the Senate. I am having a horrible time with Facebook and other social media. Our message is being shadow banned. I asked Ellen Stone our previous Madison County Republican vice chair to post my messages on her Facebook site, she got thousands of likes and response whereas my posts were only about 10.

"Wesley Morgan,Virgil Kevin Edwards,The Real Constitutional Conservatives of Kentucky","Virgil Kevin Edwards,The Real Constitutional Conservatives of Kentucky",2019-11-19 14:46:19,"Interesting!As I ponder my own run for office, I have a multi faceted platform which Id like to share. 1) Election Reform - all individuals regardless of political party or the lack thereof shall have equal access to the ballot and debate stage.   2) Decriminalization of marijuana - its not enough to just say legalize marijuana because then we still say the government has a right to decide who can and cannot grow the plant and allows it to be taxed as they see fit.  It should be treated like a tomato plant. 3) Abolishing State Income Tax - The government is simply not entitled to the fruits of your labor. 4) Abolishing property taxes - Government is not entitled to income as a result of you owning property.  In fact ownership of private property is impossible as long as government requires you to pay them annually. 5)  Abolishing all state laws regulating firearms - The Second Amendment is crystal clear that you have a right to keep and bear arms.  The Tenth Amendment is also clear that this is not a states rights issue. 6) Abolishing all state regulations on Home Schooling - The state has no right to put up road blocks to parents wishing to keep their children out of public education.  Part of this will be to abolish the school tax as it is completely unfair to charge adults who do not have kids, do not have kids in public schools, home school their kids, or have their kids in a private education setting. 7) 401-Ks for all NEW non-emergency & non-highway state public employees.  All current employees will not be affected nor will current retirees.  Non- emergency & non-highway employees should not be on a pension plan.  They can work 30-40 years like everyone else. 8) All pensions for elected legislative & executive positions shall be eliminated.  Serving the public in these capacities is a privilege and should not be treated as a career to retire from. 9) Any county without a functioning jail shall not have a paid jailer.   10) Private Property Rights Restoration Act - Owning private property is a natural & foundational right in America and that includes operating as you see fit as long as you are not depriving rights of other people.   I know many would call these things extreme.  But what has been done to people is what I would call extreme.",13,11,,2,,,,3,2504076766503786,/story.php?story_fbid=2504076766503786&id=2365214577056673

Wesley Morgan,,2019-10-23 20:39:35,"MITCH McCONNELL’S VOTING RECORD-A DISGRACE! COMMUNISM  Working with China-- Mitch McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, is the daughter of Chinese shipping magnate James Chao. She has openly used her position to enrich her family and China, while insisting on the inclusion of her relatives during meetings with China.  As noted by Newsweek, “Chao is married to Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, whose re-election campaigns have also benefited from large monetary donations from the Chao family.”   House Oversight Investigation—McConnell’s wife is now being investigated by the House Oversight and Reform Committee for her ties to China because she lied about not holding shares in her family's China-backed company, Foremost Inc. and tried to involve her family members in meetings with Chinese officials. To quote Christina Zhao of Newsweek, “'The Committee is examining your misstatements of fact, your actions that may have benefited the company in which you continued to hold shares, and your compliance with ethics and financial disclosure requirements,' the letter read. Foremost Group, a New York-based business, has received hundreds of millions of dollars in loan commitments from a Chinese government-run bank, according to the New York Times. In June, the newspaper reported that Chao tried to involve members of her family in meetings with Chinese officials that she attended in her capacity as transportation secretary... The Oversight Committee revealed in their letter, sent on Monday, that they're also investigating Chao's failure to ""divest of stock"" in Vulcan Materials Co., a construction company where she served on the Board of Directors for two years, prior to being appointed transportation secretary. 'You did not sell your shares in Vulcan until June 3, 2019 — after the Wall Street Journal published an article about your failure to divest from the company,' the letter read.”",9,8,,1,,,,4,2478664092378387,/story.php?story_fbid=2478664092378387&id=2365214577056673
Wesley Morgan,,2019-10-23 20:36:58,"MITCH McCONNELL’S VOTING RECORD-A DISGRACE! SABOTAGING THE GOP  2017-18—The Nuclear Option: McConnell refused to use the 'Nuclear Option' (which would have required that bills pass with 60 votes instead of 51), even after the GOP took control of Congress following the 2016 elections. This had the result of sabotaging Republican legislation and preventing major bills from passing while Republicans controlled Congress.  McConnell refused to allow Republicans use of the nuclear option for passing legislation by changing Senate rules to require a 51-vote margin, even though Democrats had previously used the nuclear option in both 2010 to pass Obamacare  and 2013 to pass Obama's judicial nominees.  Although McConnell finally allowed use of the Nuclear Option to pass judicial nominees in 2019 after Republicans had lost control of the House, after allowing its use for confirming Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh in 2018, he has still refused to use it for passing legislation.  To quote Paul Kane of the Washington Post, “McConnell promised to protect the supermajority on legislation, saying that filibusters on nominations are a new phenomenon but those on legislation are essential to the Senate’s essence. 'The legislative filibuster has been there a long time, everybody has been up or down, majority or minority at various times. We all understand that’s what makes the Senate the Senate,' he told reporters Tuesday.”  McConnell used the tactic to obstruct passage of border wall funding.  He also used it to prevent Republicans from passing a budget to stop the government shutdown, which ultimately allowed Democrats to extra major concessions and increase the budget; which Republicans are now continually labeled as hypocrites for allowing.   Fundraising with RINOs: McConnell also fundraises with RINOs such as Thom Tillis, Cory Gardner, and Roger Wicker.

McConnell declared war on all Tea Party candidates, saying “I think we are going to crush them everywhere. I don’t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.”   2014—Mitch McConnell slipped into the September 2014 spending bill for fiscal year 2015 a law that allows wealthy individuals to give three times the annual cap on national party donations. This took the donation cap from $32,400 to $324,000; donations not to candidates but to the national parties or committees of the party. This is how McConnell is able to defeat any conservative challenger to Republican incumbents or RINOs who disagree with McConnell, through what is known as ‘Dark Money.’  2017—Mitch McConnell, through his Dark Money PAC’s targeted and character assassinated Judge Roy Moore, a conservative Republican, villainizing him as a sexual predator, thereby allowing Democrat Doug Jones to win the 2017 Alabama U.S. Senate Special election. McConnell had one of his cronies, Luther Strange, run against Moore, openly fundraised for Strange,  and poured over $8 million dollars into the race using the Senate Leadership Fund in a futile attempt to help Strange win.  To quote Callum Borchers of the Washington Post, “To claw back some credibility as a politician who will 'drain the swamp,' Strange cannot appear too closely connected to GOP leadership. And yet Strange is relying on McConnell for financial support. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reported Thursday that as of early September, the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC, which is affiliated with McConnell, had spent $733,000 to promote Strange and another $2.5 million to air negative ads against Moore. Since Sept. 11, the Senate Leadership Fund has spent more than $720,000 on postage and printing to advance Strange's cause and oppose Moore, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.”  When Strange failed, McConnell then refused to provide financial support to Moore. McConnell also continued to attack Moore publicly, suggesting that the Senate would expel him even if he won.   2019—Mitch McConnell, through the National Republican Senatorial Fund (Dark Money) declared war on, in their words, “conservative troublemakers” while vowing to “blackball” any firm that works for a primary challenger against one of its incumbents in 2020.",8,8,,,,,,1,2478651515712978,/story.php?story_fbid=2478651515712978&id=2365214577056673

Reagan arranged for voluntary restraint agreements to limit imports of automobiles and steel. President Reagan provided temporary import relief for Harley-Davidson.

Slipped into the NDAA was the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act allowing government propaganda targeting U.S. citizens that previously could not be used domestically, ostensibly on the grounds that terrorists in Somali-immigrant communities within the United States needed to be targeted with pro-U.S. propaganda.  The Smith-Mundt Act was initially included in the House version of the 2013 NDAA, but not the Senate version.  To quote John Hudson of Foreign Policy Magazine, “For decades, a so-called anti-propaganda law prevented the U.S. government’s mammoth broadcasting arm from delivering programming to American audiences. But on July 2, that came silently to an end with the implementation of a new reform passed in January. The result: an unleashing of thousands of hours per week of government-funded radio and TV programs for domestic U.S. consumption in a reform initially criticized as a green light for U.S. domestic propaganda efforts.”  As pointed out by MPN News, “For decades, the U.S. government had been allowed to produce and disseminate propaganda abroad in order to drum up support for its foreign wars but had been banned from distributing it domestically after the passage of the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948. However, the Modernization Act’s co-authors, Reps. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) and Adam Smith (D-WA, no relation to the Smith of the 1948 act), asserted that removing the domestic ban was necessary in order to combat ‘al-Qaeda’s and other violent extremists’ influence among populations.’… given that Thornberry is one of the greatest beneficiaries of weapon manufacturers’ campaign contributions, the real intent — to skeptics at least — seemed more likely related to an effort to ramp up domestic support for U.S. military adventurism abroad following the disastrous invasions of Iraq and Libya.”  Furthermore, the NDAA allowed indefinite detention of U.S. citizens by excluding the Feinstein-Paul Amendment which had passed 67-29. McConnell voted YEA, Senator Rand Paul voted NAY.  Even Sen. Durbin (D-IL) recognized the danger caused, observing that “This provision would not prohibit long-term detention of American citizens without trial.

Wesley Morgan,,2019-10-23 19:45:31,"MITCH McCONNELL’S VOTING RECORD-A DISGRACE! OBAMACARE  2013, March 20—H.R. 933 as amended: Bill contained funding for Obamacare. McConnell voted YEA, Senator Rand Paul voted NAY. (Even Senator John McCain had the good sense to vote NAY on this legislation.)   2013—H.R. 933: McConnell voted to let Harry Reid Fund ObamaCare. (2013, RCV 206) Senator McConnell voted to end debate and allow Senate Democrats to re-insert funding for ObamaCare into the Continuing Resolution to fund the Federal government. Although McConnell did vote against the final bill, he and all Republicans knew that voting for cloture to end debate would allow Senator Harry Reid to fund ObamaCare by a party-line vote, and thus a vote for cloture was a de facto vote to fund ObamaCare.   2017-18—Preserving Obamacare: Despite campaigning on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, once Republicans had a supermajority from 2017-18 allowing them to pass any legislation they wanted to, McConnell began blocking all attempts to remove Obamacare. On May 4, 2017 the House passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. However, the Senate under McConnell refused to even bring it up for a vote.   McConnell refused to even introduce a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, instead introducing a 'skinny' bill that kept Obamacare fully intact.  John McCain then narrowly defeated the bill because it did not repeal Obamacare as promised, and he wanted the bill to go through a regular committee process instead of being rushed through without debate in the same way Obamacare had been passed.   To quote The Hill, “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled to reporters on Wednesday that he doesn’t have any plans to move again this year to repeal ObamaCare, even though Republicans might now have a better chance of success after Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) was sworn in. Senate Republicans view Kyl as someone more likely to vote with GOP leaders on health care reform legislation than was late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the maverick whom Kyl replaced after his death.”  McConnell then, despite never having attempted repeal of Obamacare, began insisting that Republicans needed to work with Democrats on healthcare.  In October 2017, a bill was presented by McConnell's liberal allies Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, but John McCain and Rand Paul blocked it because it did not repeal Obamacare as promised.  McConnell continued attempting to shut down efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare throughout 2017 and 2018 despite intense opposition from other GOP Senators who wanted the Republican Party to keep their key promise of 'repeal and replace' made when passing so many repeal bills in years past.  In 2019 he ignored calls by Donald Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare.",6,4,,,2,,,,2478617182383078,/story.php?story_fbid=2478617182383078&id=2365214577056673

Federal bureaucracies  pound American businesses and workers at  every turn. Day by day, law by law, regulation by  regulation, the federal government  encroaches on States’ rights and our  individual rights as citizens. We all  see it happening. Our children’s future  is being sold down the river by D.C.  politicians and bureaucrats who want to  hand out Political favors and turn the  bill over to future generations. We all know it's happening, whether we are  Democrats or Republicans.  We are all AMERICANS FIRST. So what can we  do about it? COSA  Kentucky Needs You  !!! Convention of States Kentucky is made up of  regular, everyday citizens (22,000 +) building a  grassroots movement right here in Kentucky  to encourage our Legislators in Frankfort to  pass our resolution to call for an Article V  Convention of States. As Article V of our Constitution states,  “when the Legislatures of two thirds of the  States send an application to congress, the  congress shall call a Convention of the States  for the purpose of proposing amendments.”  Many of our Kentucky legislators are on board  with this idea of returning power back to the  States as established in our Constitution, but  many still need to hear from the Citizens of  Kentucky. You can become active on any  level that you choose with the Convention of  States. You can SIGN OUR PETITION.  The petition simply asks your Legislator to  support our Kentucky resolution to call for a  convention.  If you would like to Volunteer, you  can do it on a level that fits in with your  schedule and your time constraints. We need  volunteers to send emails to their Legislator  or to sit down for 10 minutes to write a Personal letter to your Representatives. We need folks who will call the office of your  Legislator or visit your Legislator’s local office.   We need help in working with the media to spread  the COS word.  As a growing grassroots organization we need YOU  to help us as we stand for OUR RIGHTS AS CITIZENS,  for Kentucky’s rights as a sovereign state and  for the future of our children. Kentucky will stand, but she will not stand alone.  Convention of States is organized in all 50 states.

Morgan Bills.xlsx To the Kentucky News Media, I am calling a news conference at the Capitol Rotunda, State Capitol Building, Frankfort, Kentucky for Tuesday, December 17, 2019, at 1:00 PM.  At that time, I will file with the Kentucky Secretary of State as a candidate for U. S Senate, in the May 19, 2020 Republican Primary.  After filing, I will proceed to the Capitol Rotunda, where I will make a statement concerning my candidacy and answer any questions the news media may have. I have attached to this email 1) a list of all bills I sponsored or co-sponsored while I was a Kentucky State Representative for House District 81 during 2017 and 2018 2) an Op-Ed I wrote in June 2019 along with assistance from my daughter Jordan Morgan and Virgil Edwards and 3) Mitch McConnell’s voting record while he has been a Kentucky U. S Senator. I strongly urge you to review this information, especially the voting record of McConnell, I think you will be shocked! In addition,  please pay particular attention to these four things; 1) The Smith Mundt Modernization Act which McConnell and Harry Reed slipped into the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, 2) H.R 5181, The Countering Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda Act, which McConnell slipped into the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, 3) The 2014 Congressional Spending bill, where McConnell increased the amount of a campaign contribution from $32,400 to $324,000 to political parties or committees of political parties, not individual candidates. This is known as “Dark Money” and is used to disenfranchise the voters and, 4) The fact that McConnell refused to recess the Senate in August 2019, that prevented President Trump from making any “Recess Appointments”, that would have allowed the President to fill all his appointments through 2020. Then McConnell campaigns that he must be reelected in order to get these conservative nominees confirmed by the Senate. I am having a horrible time with Facebook and other social media. Our message is being shadow banned.

Kentucky Electric Cooperatives launched a grassroots site, https://ruralpowerky.com/takeaction/1423/ for information about issues affecting safe, reliable, and affordable electricity while allowing direct communication with legislators.  I figured since this is tax related that it might be a good place to put this?
