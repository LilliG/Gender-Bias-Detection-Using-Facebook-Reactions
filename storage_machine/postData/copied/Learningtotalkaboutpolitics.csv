"Duty Now For The Future,Duty Now For The Future",,2020-03-28 00:30:37,"Had this pinned to the top of the Page but changed the pinned post to my campaign announcement. Reposting to keep near the top of the TimelineThe US Senate has a long running tradition of reading George Washington's Farewell Address every year on his birthday. You probably don't ever hear about it as in his address he warns about dangers of political parties... Here is an excerpt of George Washington's comments in is Farewell Address regarding political parties: ""I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party, generally. This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy. The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty. Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it. It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another..."" http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Washingtons_Farewell_Address.htm",,,,,,,,,2564707087102679,/story.php?story_fbid=2564707087102679&id=1770550639851665
Duty Now For The Future,,2019-09-22 20:07:06,"This is a letter I am going to have delivered to General Jim Mattis Dear former US Secretary of Defense, General Jim Mattis, I saw recently that you were asked what you thought this countries greatest National Security threats are. To paraphrase… you broke down your response into 2 categories, one being external and the other being internal. The internal threats you described were basically: 1) The current partisan divide and 2) our National debt. I know you are no longer in the Executive branch, but I don’t think these problems are going to be solved by anyone currently in Government anyway. It just needs the right person who understands the importance of having a good specific strategic plan of action along with specific metrics to measure success by. I know you are busy with your book tour, so let me know if you need some help. Thanks, Jeffrey Grünau",,,,,,,,,2405992296307493,/story.php?story_fbid=2405992296307493&id=1770550639851665
