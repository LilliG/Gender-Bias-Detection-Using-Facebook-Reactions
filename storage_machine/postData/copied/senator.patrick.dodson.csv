The clinic will operate from 8.30am-4pm, seven days a week and will be staffed by clinicians and administrative teams following strict infection control measures.  Anybody with either a fever of or above 38 degrees or an acute respiratory infection should present for testing as soon as possible.  In other Kimberley communities, those requiring testing are able to attend any WA Country Health Service hospital or health service or clinics operated by Aboriginal Medical Services or the Royal Flying Doctor Service.  As of Saturday night, more than 240 COVID tests have been undertaken in the Kimberley with 170 of those occurring in Broome. The community is reminded that the COVID clinic is not intended to replace medical care available through general practitioners or at a hospital emergency department.

"Patrick Dodson,Mark McGowan",,2020-04-02 06:39:16,"IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE WA GOVERNMENT FOR THE KIMBERLEY üëáüèæUnfortunately, we have already seen a number of COVID-19 cases in the Kimberley region, which is of serious concern. We know just how vulnerable the Kimberley and the Aboriginal community is in this situation - so we cannot take any chances. There are already strict measures in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 throughout the Kimberley, particularly residents in remote Aboriginal communities.  Access to the Kimberley is strictly restricted, under State and Commonwealth law - and is closed to tourists and visitors. Additional restrictions also already apply to specific communities.  However, further restrictions to stop the movement of people between towns or local government areas are now being introduced. Effective from 11.59pm tonight, additional restrictions will be in place in the Kimberley region.  New boundaries, in line with the four local government areas are now in place. People MUST stay in their local government area. The existing exemptions apply, such as provision of essential services or supplies, medical reasons or residents returning to their home.  Kimberley residents are urged to stay home and cease all non-essential travel and activity. Indoor or outdoor activities of more than two people should be avoided, unless exempted. Anyone displaying symptoms should contact their local health facility immediately. I want to thank the local Aboriginal organisations for the work they are doing throughout the region. The Department of Health is working closely with important local agencies to ensure a proactive and coordinated approach.",54,46,,2,1,5,,,1362284073963850,/story.php?story_fbid=1362284073963850&id=506449812880618
"Patrick Dodson,Mark McGowan",,2020-04-02 02:19:46,"The number of new cases in Western Australia continues to be very encouraging, and shows that the measures we have taken so far are starting to have a positive impact. But we cannot afford to take our foot off the pedal. The health pandemic is here in Western Australia, and unfortunately it won‚Äôt be leaving any time soon. But if we follow the advice, abide by the new rules and practice good social distancing, we can take a different direction to the rest of the country and the rest of the world. Western Australia is in a unique position - our isolation is now our best defence. And now, we must use it to our advantage. That‚Äôs why we have taken the unprecedented steps of introducing regional boundaries and brought in tough measures to restrict movement and social interaction. But as the situation continues to evolve around the world and across Australia, we need to take further steps to protect our State. We currently have restrictions in place for people coming into WA, and requiring 14 days of self-isolation - and those restrictions are working. But it makes sense that we go further now, and close Western Australia's border. Based on the medical advice, we will move to introduce a hard border closure effective from midnight, or 11.59pm, on Sunday night. I want the message to be absolutely clear to any Western Australian over east who is thinking of coming back to WA.  If you need to get home to WA ‚Äì come home immediately. If you are an eastern-stater, and thinking about visiting WA ‚Äì forget about it. While we are this State of Emergency, we need you to stay where you are. The quicker we can get through this, the sooner we can get back to normal. In effect, this decision will be turning Western Australia into its own island - our own country. These are drastic steps, but also sensible and workable - and they will give us the best chance of combating the virus and minimising the spread throughout our community. A number of specific exemptions will be implemented to ensure our State can continue to operate and function. The exemptions are currently being finalised, but they will include people who perform work functions including: - Health services - Emergency service workers - Transport, freight and logistics - Specialists skills, not available in WA, - National or State security and governance, and - Courts and judicial services; There will also be exemptions for FIFO workers and their families, however strict 14-day self-isolation measures will need to be followed, when they first enter the State. Further exemptions will also apply on specific compassionate grounds. We are living in extraordinary times. It is like something we have all never experienced before. But I am just so proud of the WA response. The wider WA community have responded to this with true Western Australian spirit. Everyone knows that we are in this together ‚Äì and for that, I know, we will get through this. If you had asked me a couple months ago that we would be closing the WA border, I would have laughed. But, unfortunately, this is no laughing matter. This is serious. We are serious.",82,75,,7,,,,,1362181217307469,/story.php?story_fbid=1362181217307469&id=506449812880618

"Patrick Dodson,Mark McGowan",,2020-03-27 00:19:18,"IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM WA GOVERNMENT üëáüèæI'm sure you've heard me say it before - travelling around Western Australia is a world-class experience. From the unique landscapes of the Kimberley and Pilbara to the gourmet paradise of the South West, and everything in between, our State has so much to see and do. But, sadly, this just isn't the time for it. We've made the extremely difficult and completely unprecedented decision to shut down travel between WA's regions. From midnight Tuesday, restrictions will be placed on travel within the entire State of Western Australia. Western Australians will not be permitted to leave their regional boundary.  It‚Äôs absolutely vital every Western Australian understands ‚Äì you cannot travel within WA. It must stop immediately.  Police have the power to enforce these restrictions if necessary, and fines of up to $50,000 can be issued. To be clear, those are: the Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne, Mid-West, Goldfields-Esperance, Wheatbelt, Great Southern and South West. Due to their proximity and interconnected nature, Perth and Peel will be treated as one region. The health and safety of people in regional Western Australia must be our priority. Exemptions will apply for, among other things, essential services and workers, including health and emergency services; people living in ‚Äòborder communities‚Äô, who may not have access to groceries or supplies within their region; employment purposes; medical reasons; transport of essential goods and some compassionate grounds.  Additional restrictions to remote Aboriginal communities were announced by Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt this week, to provide extra protection to these vulnerable communities.  If you are currently away from home - you need to come back. Now. If you were planning a trip - you cannot go.  But I have one important request - don't cancel your bookings with our regional hotels, tours or other providers - postpone them instead. This won't last forever, so let's do what we can to make sure those businesses are still there once it is over. That next trip will just be so much sweeter.",27,26,,,1,,,,1356919691166955,/story.php?story_fbid=1356919691166955&id=506449812880618
Patrick Dodson,,2020-03-26 02:37:54,"IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE WA GOVERNMENT: ACCESS RESTRICTED TO PROTECT PEOPLE LIVING IN THE KIMBERLEY AND REMOTE ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES Thursday, 26 March 2020 ‚ÄãThe Western Australian Government has partnered with the Commonwealth Government to implement new restrictions for access to designated regions in the State to protect the health and wellbeing of residents in the Kimberley and remote Aboriginal communities.  From 9pm on Thursday March 26, 2020, access will be restricted into the following regions: - Kimberley (comprising all four local government areas); - Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku; - Parts of the Shire of East Pilbara that encompass the communities of Jigalong, Martu homeland communities and Kiwirrkurra. These designated areas account for approximately a third of the geographical area of the State; and almost 90 per cent of Western Australia's remote communities and the remote Aboriginal population. Under these arrangements, after 9pm on Thursday, March 26, 2020, any person who is outside a designated region can only enter that region if that person: - is providing essential services or supplies; or - has been quarantined from the general public for the previous 14 days Other special exemptions may apply. The restrictions for the designated regions are enforceable through emergency determination powers under the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth). A jail term of up to five years could apply to those who breach the determination. Within the designated regions and for all remote Aboriginal communities outside these designated regions, the State Government's Remote Aboriginal Communities Directions will continue to apply. The directions mean that the only people who can enter a remote Aboriginal community are residents, those providing essential services and supplies, and those entering for family or cultural reasons. Breaches of these directions could attract a fine of up to $50,000. The State Government continues to work with community organisations and the mining industry to assist residents of remote Aboriginal communities to return home. For more information, visit http://www.wa.gov.au/aboriginalcommunities Here's a map of the three regions affected. Important to note that the change doesn't affect movement WITHIN the regions, but restricts access to those wanting to enter.",127,113,,14,,,,,1356087134583544,/story.php?story_fbid=1356087134583544&id=506449812880618
