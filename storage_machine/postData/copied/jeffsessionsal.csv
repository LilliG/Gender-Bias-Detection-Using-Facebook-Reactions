Jeff Sessions,,2020-02-05 17:00:39,"My FULL STATEMENT on the U.S. Senate's Acquittal of President Trump: The Democrats’ partisan impeachment charade has been a national tragedy. In our Republic’s 243-year history, the House of Representatives has only twice before undertaken and approved articles of impeachment against a President — and then only with clear and compelling evidence.  As I have stated from the beginning on multiple national and local news programs, it was clear that the evidence put forward by Speaker Pelosi and Representative Schiff was nowhere close to justifying an impeachment, much less the removal, of the President.  Yet the House Democrats deliberately doubled down, and voted to impeach. When their flimsy charges were exposed in the Senate, Congressional Democrats, aided by Alabama’s Senator Doug Jones, sought to change the narrative by demanding to hear from additional witnesses. But all of their machinations could not change the fundamental truth: the facts of the case did not support their impeachment charge.  House Democrats have committed a very grave wrong. For political gain, they have created turmoil and sowed division in the country. Their obsession with impeachment was the product of enmity, irresponsibility, and hyper-partisanship. It was also a product of the Democrats’ fear. They fear our strong President, who is boldly standing up for the American people and who is delivering day after day on his promises to the American people.  Doug Jones is deeply complicit in this grave wrong. In voting to remove our duly-elected President, Doug Jones personifies the left’s irrational enmity against President Trump. Jones is a foot soldier for Chuck Schumer and the radical left, and he has made it clear that he is in the U.S. Senate to represent Washington Democrats, not the people of Alabama. Now, thankfully, this impeachment charade has ended. Now, we must focus on the future, the business of the American people. Congress, including Republicans, must give full focus to advancing the people’s agenda. Much has been accomplished, but more needs to be done. It is time to end illegality at the border. It is time to support President Trump as he negotiates trade agreements with Europe, China, and other nations, to the benefit of the American worker.  It is time to build on the economic foundation laid by President Trump in his first term, where wages have increased for American workers for the first time in twenty years.  The state of our republic is strong, even as many of the people’s representatives in Congress have wasted weeks and no doubt thousands of taxpayer dollars on a partisan, obsessive quest to find some evidence, somewhere, that would damage and remove the people’s duly-elected President. The Democrats' partisan fishing expedition has failed — and now is the moment for Congress to productively work alongside President Trump to advance his America First agenda.",298,243,1,53,,,1,23,159318052184911,/story.php?story_fbid=159318052184911&id=106123517504365

One study projects the new USMCA will add as much as 1% to America's GDP. The replacement of NAFTA is a major defeat for the extreme free traders who have argued that trade deficits don’t matter, and who have opposed countless efforts to fight back against cheating, fraud, and even technology theft. I led the fight in the Senate against another disastrous trade deal, President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which had strong backing from many in my own party. Later, after he started his campaign, President Trump hammered the TPP, and the then-strong support for the TPP quickly evaporated. If Congress will stand with President Trump, we will make much more progress to protect American jobs and manufacturing. Make no mistake, China represents the biggest threat. We must establish far tougher policies with China to protect American jobs and manufacturing from their predatory practices. As your Senator, I led this critical, common sense fight before, and I will again.

Jeff Sessions,,2020-01-28 14:09:01,"We live in very dangerous and serious times. There is a multi-front battle raging for the soul and the future of our country. We have before us great opportunity, and also great peril. The stakes are very high, and I am uniquely qualified and prepared to represent and defend Alabama and American values in this battle. The radical left has captured the Democrat Party and the threat is real and dire. The wolf is at the door. This is their agenda, and they are very open about it: – Socialism – Medicare for All (which kills health insurance for 50% of Americans) – Open borders – Free healthcare for illegals – The Green New Deal (which would bankrupt and destroy our economy) – Confiscation of firearms – Curtailing freedom of speech and religion. Alabama must send someone to Washington who has the courage, the knowledge, and the backbone to stand up against this madness, and to actually stop it. I can, and I will. When conservative voters were flocking to support Donald Trump in the primary in 2016, but Republican Senators were hiding under their desks, only one U.S. Senator had the courage to stand up on stage and endorse President Trump. I stood up for Alabama values. In 2013 when Republican leaders in Washington were on the verge of capitulating to the Democrats and accepting illegal immigration and amnesty as the law of the land, I stopped them. I stood up for Alabama values. When Republicans in Washington were allowing the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal to go through, a deal which may have been good for Wall Street, but would have been disastrous for American workers, I stopped them. I stood up for Alabama values. When I took over the Department of Justice, I reversed Obama Administration policies that unfairly targeted Christian and conservative organizations, and I made it the policy of the U.S. Government to defend people of faith in every court in our nation. The liberal press attacked me, but I didn’t care — I stood up for Alabama values. I defended our men and women of law enforcement, and I promised them that the U.S. Department of Justice would support their efforts to keep Americans safe. Let’s be very clear — every candidate can get up in front of a crowd and beat their chest and tell folks what they want to hear. That’s easy. And we have some individuals running who give a nice political speech. But talk is cheap. The question is, who is ready to step into the breach and represent Alabama values in the U.S. Senate immediately? Who is ready, and capable, of fighting for President Trump’s agenda? Who can make it happen? Time is short, this battle is raging right now, and we have to win this fight. Make no mistake — the Democrats in Washington are seeking to fundamentally redefine America, change our ideals, and divide us from each other. I am certainly not the favorite of the Washington establishment crowd, but I am the one with the courage, the knowledge, the backbone, and the ability to get the job done for Alabama. Senator Doug Jones is a radical liberal who voted against Justice Kavanaugh and who would certainly vote for Chuck Schumer to be majority leader in the Senate. We must defeat him. I can, and I will, and the Democrats know this. These are serious times; Alabama needs to send a warrior to Washington.

Jeff Sessions,,2019-12-18 18:14:58,"The Democratic House is abusing the awesome impeachment power in our Constitution.  In our long Constitutional history, there has never been such an unjustified impeachment. These charges are vague and utterly lacking in merit and entirely political. “Obstruction of Congress""? Really? What do these vague words even mean? The Congress obstructs President Trump every single day. The courts obstruct the Congress and the Executive Branch on a regular basis. It is built into our system.   “Abuse of Power""? Really? What a joke. For the Democrats, ""abuse of power"" simply means anything that they do not agree with — anything that makes them angry. This action is certain to produce lasting consequences. Some things in this life can’t be undone. This will be a stain on the House of Representatives forever.   This country is booming under President Trump’s policies — it has never been stronger. His policies are common sense, are working, and are what the American people want.   President Trump stands up for the average American every single day, and the elitist Democrats respond with personal attacks. They will rue the day that they did this. They are not hurting President Trump; they are hurting America and themselves. The Democratic leader in the Senate, Senator Chuck Schumer, will try all his antics. He is all politics, all the time. He will try to send the Senate on a fishing expedition for evidence. Why? Because he knows there exists no evidence that comes close to justifying impeachment or removal.   When this is all over, the Democrats will owe an apology to President Trump, and more importantly, they will owe an apology to the American people. This is true because it is the people’s will, and the public interest, that is being obstructed. #alsen",355,300,1,30,4,4,16,56,132984378151612,/story.php?story_fbid=132984378151612&id=106123517504365
