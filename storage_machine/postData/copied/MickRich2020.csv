Trump‚Äôs court appointments and views on abortion and gun control appear, like Reagan‚Äôs, to have won over the large evangelical community and rural voters who strongly favor gun rights. Both formed the bedrock of Reagan‚Äôs coalition and now hold a similar position in Trump‚Äôs. There are also current Trump policies that Reagan probably would have adopted if he had been elected president in 2016 instead of 1980: moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; imposing tariffs on Chinese products as a way to bring China to the trade negotiating table; withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear treaty with Iran; withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement; and killing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/01/15/reagan_trump_have_more_in_common_than_attacks_on_gadhafi_soleimani_142146.html",81,70,,10,1,,,2,2719673821445544,/story.php?story_fbid=2719673821445544&id=966291493450461

Mick Rich,,2019-11-11 11:50:13,"Letter from a Vietnam Veteran  Mick,  When I retired from the military, I was responsible for 102 people. It was my job to clothe, feed, house, discipline and reward them, to ensure their just treatment ‚Äì and above all, to see that they were highly trained to accomplish their mission. The thing I miss most about serving is taking care of my troops.    turn their backs on us and allow the VA to do whatever it wants. You cannot imagine what it does to me to hear a Congressman say that he will do nothing about the VA because it is too hard. Here is my definition of hard:  1.   Sitting in the open door of a helicopter as it flies into a field, with green tracers coming at you from the tree line, that terrible banging you hear as rounds hit your helicopter. At this point you realize that the only thing between you and those rounds is the front of your shirt. That is hard.  2.   Walking point in the jungle knowing that if you miss one thing, you and a lot of people around you will be dead. That is hard.  3.   Leading troops on a mission where it is very likely that some of them will not come back alive. That is hard.   To hear any U.S. Representative say that fixing the VA is too hard is an insult to those of us who have served in harm‚Äôs way. These people do not deserve one vote ‚Äì let alone the votes of veterans.   Jim --   Jim,   I was not quite a teenager when my brother was drafted into the Vietnam War. A couple of years later, when my brother was discharged, my father met him in Oakland. My father must have known what it would be like, because he would not let me join him to meet my brother.    When our Vietnam veterans came home, they were mistreated by our country and our countrymen. I will never forget that lesson.      If I am elected, we will have a Senator in Washington who cares about and defends veterans.
