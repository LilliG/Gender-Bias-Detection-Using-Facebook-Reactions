"Tom Emerson, Jr for US Senate, Tennessee",,2019-11-30 06:54:35,"Only in America.           Pretty Amazing! A blogger added up the deer license sales in just a handful of states and arrived at a striking conclusion: There were over 600,000 hunters this season in the state of Wisconsin .. Allow me to restate that number: 600,000! Over the last several months, Wisconsin 's hunters became the eighth largest army in the world. (Thatâ€™s more men under arms than in Iran . More than France and Germany combined. ) These men, deployed to the woods of a single American state, Wisconsin, to hunt with firearms, and NO ONE WAS KILLED. That number pales in comparison to the 750,000 who hunted the woods ofPennsylvania and Michigan 's 700,000 hunters, ALL OF WHOM HAVE RETURNED HOME SAFELY. Toss in a quarter million hunters in West Virginia and it literally establishes the fact that the hunters of those four states alone would comprise the largest army in the world. And then add in the total number of hunters in the other 46 states. It's millions more. ________ The point? _______________________________________ America will forever be safe from foreign invasion with that kind of home-grown firepower! Hunting... it's not just a way to fill the freezer. It's a matter of national security. *************************************** That's why all enemies, foreign and domestic, want to see us disarmed. Food for thought, when next we consider gun control, whether you agree with it or not. Overall it's true, so if we disregard some assumptions that hunters don't possess the same skills as soldiers, the question would still remain... What army of 2 million would want to face 30 million, 40 million, or 50 million armed citizens??? For the sake of our freedom, don't ever allow gun control or confiscation of guns. (IF YOU AGREE, AS I DO, PASS IT ON, I FEEL GOOD THAT I HAVE AN ARMY OF MILLIONS WHO WOULD PROTECT OUR LAND AND I SURE DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TAKING CONTROL OF THE POSSESSION OF FIREARMS) GOD BLESS AMERICA!!",,,,,,,,,1641792279278727,/story.php?story_fbid=1641792279278727&id=256803427777626
