Abby Broyles,,2020-02-23 11:36:51,"Yesterday I saw firsthand the devastating effects of the chronic flooding in Miami, Oklahoma. While flooding shut down schools and businesses for weeks last year and first responders couldn’t get to parts of town with streets closed, my opponent quietly slipped an amendment into the defense spending bill in Washington to keep the water levels high at Grand Lake (where he has a lake home), causing more flooding upstream in Miami. The Inhofe amendment, which lifts regulations on the Grand River Dam Authority, means the flooding — that leaves behind millions of dollars in damage each time to this city with a budget of just $5 million — will only get worse. To add insult to injury, Inhofe was pushing this amendment in DC while Miami city leaders were meeting with Inhofe’s staff back in Oklahoma to discuss how to pay for the infrastructure damage caused by the flooding. Inhofe’s staff never said a word about what their boss was doing; Miami city leaders were informed of the amendment by the DC press. These families have been through enough. Their property values have plummeted, their roads left in disrepair, and economic development isn’t promising.

Also joining us was Abby Broyles, candidate for US Senate. She is a native of Bethany. You may recognize her as a journalist from the local news.  She is practicing attorney who is running for the seat currently held by incumbent Jim Inholfe.  She covered her platform and took questions from the audience.

Also on the agenda, updating the city policy on medical marijuana usage by city employees, expanding the languages in the housing code to include federally protected statuses, and the presentation of the strategic plan and studies for 2020.

It’s been a little stressful 😉 I vividly remember on my last graduation day - undergrad - getting a call from a news director for a traffic reporter job in Houston. I was thrilled. Interviewed, but didn’t get the job for whatever reason (which worked out for everyone’s benefit - I’m horrible at directions 😜). But I was so disappointed. I was barely 20 & thought this was a huge setback (ha!). I immediately started making more resume tapes and mailing them off at the post office daily.  I’ve been fortunate to have had an incredible TV career so far - from reporting from Oklahoma’s death row to breaking stories about political corruption.  I’ve also made lifelong friends in many of my colleagues. Still, three years ago I wasn’t where I wanted to be. I needed a challenge. Something to help me refocus and pull me out of my comfort zone.  So here I am. I’m excited to add another dimension to my career with a law degree. (By the way, law school is no joke - I quickly learned to study when and wherever I could.) I’m looking forward to seeing where this next chapter takes me and the people I can impact along the way. Some of the greatest influencers I know are lawyers. I woke up this morning thinking about that first TV job I didn’t get when I was 20 (oh, the heartbreak! 😆) and the ride it’s been all the years since then. Here’s what I’ve learned: Think big. Don’t limit yourself. Success comes to those who choose to live the life they want.

Susan Still’s life story of escaping a horrific domestic violence cycle was both haunting and moving. In Oklahoma, it’s an all too familiar story - the domestic violence statistics are terrible. I saw it firsthand prosecuting domestic violence cases. Families are destroyed, and dozens upon dozens of Oklahomans are killed every year. BUT, the incredible work the YWCA does is lifesaving.

I could answer with: I’m a practicing attorney & I started a successful TV career in a cut-throat corporate man’s world when I was 20, but the most straightforward answer I have is this. I’m like my friends who want affordable, quality healthcare. I want my neighbors to retire with dignity, and I want our Oklahoma kids - our future - to have the best quality education possible. Bottom line: I’m tired of DC partisan politics. I’m tired of a Senator who refuses to act.

,,2019-05-19 22:12:42,"Today I graduated from law school. ⚖️ I’m forever grateful to my family and friends who have been so supportive over the past 3 years. It’s been a little stressful 😉 I vividly remember on my last graduation day - undergrad - getting a call from a news director for a traffic reporter job in Houston. I was thrilled. Interviewed, but didn’t get the job for whatever reason (which worked out for everyone’s benefit - I’m horrible at directions 😜). But I was so disappointed. I was barely 20 & thought this was a huge setback (ha!). I immediately started making more resume tapes and mailing them off at the post office daily.  I’ve been fortunate to have had an incredible TV career so far - from reporting from Oklahoma’s death row to breaking stories about political corruption.  I’ve also made lifelong friends in many of my colleagues. Still, three years ago I wasn’t where I wanted to be. I needed a challenge. Something to help me refocus and pull me out of my comfort zone.  So here I am. I’m excited to add another dimension to my career with a law degree. (By the way, law school is no joke - I quickly learned to study when and wherever I could.) I’m looking forward to seeing where this next chapter takes me and the people I can impact along the way. Some of the greatest influencers I know are lawyers. I woke up this morning thinking about that first TV job I didn’t get when I was 20 (oh, the heartbreak! 😆) and the ride it’s been all the years since then. Here’s what I’ve learned: Think big. Don’t limit yourself. Success comes to those who choose to live the life they want.
