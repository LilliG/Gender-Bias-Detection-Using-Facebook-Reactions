Willie Wilson,,2020-01-26 21:10:00,"The tragic & untimely death of NBA Legend Kobe Bryant and his 13-year old daughter, Gianna is devastating news that transcends sports & basketball. He was an extraordinary player, yes, but was an unspeakably excellent example of a young, black man that made us all proud. Like me, he rose above what anyone ever imagined or expected. He was a remarkable inspiration to not only his own generation, but to millions, worldwide. I relate to his fierce competitive spirit, refusal to lose and relentless pursuit of excellence. It is an example for us all. May we all expect greatness of ourselves & insist our young generation reach for a standard of excellence as the example set by Kobe. I, too, lost a child tragically. My condolences & prayers especially to Kobe's wife, Vanessa, in the loss of Kobe & their daughter Gianna, to his other three daughters and the extended Bryant family.

Seek all state laws and policies that have a disproportional negative effect on People of African Descent citizens and dismantle or neutralize the injurious law and/or policy. b.    Put in place mechanisms that examine all future public policy to ensure that a racial bias/outcome does not materialize. c.    Immediately pass legislation that would halt and greatly deter the degree of wrongful deaths of people of African descent-citizens in Illinois by any city or quasi-city department or agency. 2)    Restitution a.    Preservation of Black neighborhoods and communities through investment in business development, homeownership and affordable housing at the median income of each neighborhood- with a full range of housing services: and strengthening of institutions – which shall include without limitations schools, parks, and community centers. b.    Build and develop a Vocational Training Center for People of African Descent-Citizens VTCPADC, with satellites throughout the State to address the racial disparity in the building trades and the de-skilling of Black labor through the historic discrimination in the building trade unions.  The VTCPADC shall also have departments for legitimate activities in the Informal Economy and Apprenticeship. c.    Ensure proportional economic representation in all state contracts - review and update of the State of Illinois’ procurement and contracting requirements and procedures with the express goal of increasing the number of African American vendors and contracts for services to an equitable level reflecting their population in the state (14 percent). 3)    Compensation a.    Create and enforce a Illinois Slavery Era Disclosure Bill mandating that in addition to disclosure, an affidavit must be submitted entitled  “Statement of Financial Reparations” that has been negotiated with the Commission established under this resolution and the corporation or institution that disclosed ties to the enslavement or injury of people of African descent in the United States of America. b.    Establish a Community Trust Fund with annual contributions from the State of Illinois as well as corporations and institutions cited above that will benefit the African American communities in Illinois.

The State Colleges of Illinois in collaboration with other appropriate agencies shall develop a plan to provide free education to People of African Descent Citizens. d.    Inclusion of reparations curriculum in the public school system consistent with, and beginning with, the United Nations declaration that Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, Slavery, Apartheid (Jim Crow Segregation) were crimes against humanity and the continued post Jim Crow acts of red-lining, mass-incarceration, sub-prime lending, and police terrorism are continued and  exacerbating crimes that compound the injury of the previous harmful eras of enslavement and segregation. 5)    Rehabilitation a.    Establish a Center for Trans-generational Epigenetic Research, Diagnosis and Proscription that seeks to understand and counteract the deleterious effects of centuries of trauma on the DNA of people of African descent-citizens in Illinois. b.

When someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer, for then you are working out of your true selves, your God-created selves. This is what God does. He gives his best—the sun to warm and the rain to nourish—to everyone, regardless: the good and bad, the nice and nasty. If all you do is love the lovable, do you expect a bonus? Anybody can do that.
