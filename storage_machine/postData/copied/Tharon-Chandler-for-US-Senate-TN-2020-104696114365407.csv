The summer temps get very nice up into Canada, where meat products are also raised, though they typicly are not as disgusting as for growing their cattle all in one place.  In places such as Dalhart Texas, a town where rural highways 385 & 54 & 87 come together not far from Amarillo, there are places where all the 'black angus' and the Charalois, and the black & white cows eat together from a steel trough erected outside the perimeter of the same square acre where they sleep, crap, and moo all night and day.
