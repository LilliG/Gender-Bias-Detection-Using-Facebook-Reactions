Deadline is January 29th at 5pm.  Regarding Initiatives 60 and 62, both limit magazines to 10 rounds. The Oregon Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that inferring any magazines of more than 10 rounds as large capacity was arbitrary at best.  Source: https://conservativedailypost.com/oregon-supreme-court-rules-against-assault-rifle-ban-citing-vagueness/ US Constitution: Amendment II ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" Then we must fight back against these 3 ballot initiatives. You have until January 29th to write a letter and submit it. You must cite why any of the provisions in any of these initiatives are Unconstitutional. Oregon Constitution: ""Right to Bear Arms in Oregon Article 1, Section 27 of the Oregon Constitution states: ""The people shall have the right to bear arms for the defence [sic] of themselves, and the State, but the Military shall be kept in strict subordination to the civil power[.]"" Below is a link to past challenges to Oregon's Art. 1, Sec 27:  In State v. Boyce, the Court of Appeals of Oregon rejected an article 1, § 27 challenge to a Portland ordinance banning the possession of a concealable, loaded firearm in public or in a vehicle, stating that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power. The court noted that the ordinance does not regulate the ""mere possession"" of firearms or ammunition, but regulates the manner of possession. Note that subsequent to the Oregon State Shooting Ass'n and Boyce decisions, the Oregon Legislature adopted legislation preempting local jurisdictions from regulating certain firearm-related areas of the law…  Source: https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/8257 Use these resources and search for more to write your letters. My thoughts on 10 rounds. If there is more than 1 or 2 people attacking someone, and we have only 10 rounds to work with, we are going to be outnumbered in more ways than one. To tell me, a law abiding citizen, because of people who have mental health issues, decide to kill people, I cannot have a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds, the authors of IP 60 & IP 62 feel the my right to self defense is not worth more than those 10 rounds. Thus, by default giving the criminal(s) more rights than I have.

"Perkins for Congress,Jo Rae Perkins",Jo Rae Perkins,2019-11-05 21:26:02,"Early this morning I said there would be an announcement regarding my campaign team. I am honored and pleased to announce Freddie Fults Bolman is my new #CampaignManager! Freddie and I have known each other for years; since our kids were in grade school. I was looking for a person who would be able to travel with me, can keep me on task, is outgoing, insightful, organized and isn't afraid to take on a huge task!  One thing that was not wanted, was someone with the preconceived idea that we need to do politics like they do on the east coast. Oregonians are a different breed of voter, especially conservative voters. Many Republicans want true conservative leadership and representatives. They don't want the moderate middle of the road, flip floppers. They want to know the candidate and future elected official is passionate about the office they are seeking. And they want people who have life experience. Freddie and I will continue to seek volunteers to join the #PerkinsForCongress2020District4Oregon team.  If interested, please let us know. Please welcome Freddie to the team.",3,2,,1,,,,,2412886415626582,/story.php?story_fbid=2412886415626582&id=1556269487954950
