Learn more at 2020Census.gov Also known as the Population and Housing Census, the Decennial U.S. Census is designed to count every resident in the United States. It is mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and takes place every 10 years. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds to local communities. The census tells us who we are, where we are going as a nation, and helps our communities determine where to build everything from schools to supermarkets and from homes to hospitals. It helps the government decide how to distribute funds and assistance to states and localities. It is also used to draw the lines of legislative districts and reapportion the seats each State holds in Congress. The 2010 Census represented the most massive participation movement ever witnessed in our country. Approximately 74 percent of the households returned their census forms by mail; the remaining households were counted by census workers walking neighborhoods throughout the United States.Decennial Census Day (US) The 2020 Decennial Census is underway!

,,2020-04-10 09:00:00,"4-10-20: Workman withdraws from 2020 US Senate race Today I am suspending my campaign for the US Senate seat on the 2020 ballot in Oklahoma. When I informally announced for this seat on 4-22-19 (Earth Day), I stated that our state and nation needed a new Senator for the 2021-26 term up for election in Oklahoma. I also called on others to support whoever our eventual Democratic nominee in this race might be. Those concerns have not changed. Some things have changed. Since I was the first Democrat to declare for this seat, a handful of others joined this race. A few of them later withdrew and one has filed for another office. As of today, the filing deadline, there are several Democrats now officially running. I will still actively support our eventual nominee in this and all races. Within my own household, Christene is still recovering from several medical operations and procedures. In the Covid-19 pandemic, she and I are both in high risk groups. All things considered, my continuing as an active candidate does not seem prudent at this time. I extend my thanks to those who encouraged me in my efforts and call on them and others to remain engaged in the political process. ~MW",5,2,,1,1,1,,,1037133033336434,/story.php?story_fbid=1037133033336434&id=182610662122013

(checkiday) Each year on a Tuesday in March or April, National Equal Pay Day brings awareness to pay discrepancies between women and men around the world for the same work. Tuesday represents how far into the work week a woman works to earn as much a man doing the same job. While the observance is only a couple of decades old, the fight for equal pay has been going on for nearly a century. Early in the 20th century, women in the United States and around the world began taking a stand for fair pay and better working conditions, voting rights, and legal rights. Since that time, women have made great strides toward equal pay, but there is still work to be done. In 2018, employers continued to fail to pay equally skilled women the same amount of pay they were paying their male counterparts. While education gave women an edge, they still were paid 88% of what their male equivalents. In positions that didnâ€™t require analytical skills, the gap increased to 83%. (Pew Research, January 20, 2020). More women are in the workplace, too. They also hold more skilled positions. With the demand for skilled workers increasing, womenâ€™s hourly wages are growing faster than men. However, despite that, the gap remains. (Pew Research, January 30, 2020). Equal Pay Day first started in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity to bring awareness to demonstrate wage inequities between men and women.
