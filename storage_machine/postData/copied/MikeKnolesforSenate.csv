Mike Knoles for Senate,,2020-02-19 03:05:54,"(This turned into a novel. I was thinking about curing it down, but I'm just gonna run with it.) . . It is imperative that we, as a country, come together to protect our ecology. If we do not, we as a human race will destroy ourselves. We cannot treat Mother Earth this way and expect Her to continue to be habitable. It's not really that the Earth is warming up and it really doesn't matter who or what are responsible. Our usage of single use plastics, overfishing, the acidification of our oceans, our network of highways, our rampant use of concrete and our farms that replace vegetation including trees that act as natural carbon sinks, our overuse of antibacterials that are polluting our water (not to mention the rest of the pollution and spreading of weeds), and so many other destructive habits that we as humans do cannot continue. The end result will be the death of the human race. Life on Earth will go on just as it did with the dinosaurs, and at least graminoids will continue to survive until the sun becomes a red giant and consumes the Earth a billion or so years from now. Dolphins will likely survive if we don't take them down with us. Dolphins, crows, bees, dogs, something will survive us and, hopefully, become sentient enough to find record of us in our fossils. That record will be encrusted in a layer of plastic. Our era will be named after their word for plastic. Seriously. The acidification of our oceans will dissolve the shells of many creatures. This isn't fear mongering or apocalyptic speak. This is science. This is ""the math"" people keep asking for. You can do your own experiments and research to verify everything I'm saying, or you could go outside and look around you. Imagine what the space you are currently sitting, standing, or lying down at looked like 300 years ago? What's different between now and then? How would you expect the biome on Earth to respond to this kind of drastic shift in it's ecologic structure in such a short amount of time (relative to the history of life on Earth)? We are the proverbial virus. Mother Earth is sick and we are the culprits. We are the disease, and the forces of nature will respond, and if we do not change our relationship with Her, we will not survive. The good news is we are still charitable of fixing this, but if we don't act fast and make serious changes with the way we treat the land, water, and air around us, life for our children and generations beyond will suffer. It is extremely negligent of us not to care. We knew about this in the 70s. That's when we should have changed our filthy habits. It did not take a prophet or mystic to figure this out, but, honestly, they knew long before us. Go reread the words of our poets. Go watch old films where they talk about environmentalism. Go listen to Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"". Go watch Fern Gully. Go talk to a Native American Elder. We've been preaching this to ourselves for a long time, but we continue to refuse to listen. Montana, America, the World, I speak to you. To every local community. To the friends and church members I met in Keokuk and Nauvoo when I was very young. To Mrs Ferguson who taught me to count and spell and how to use a hammer. To my father and mother and sisters and brothers and cousins and aunts and uncles and grandparents and surrogate family members who took me in and treated me like family and saw my pain and comforted me when I was in need. To Mrs Armstrong who gave me a love for space exploration by being super excited about sharing a last name Lance. To the rest of my friends in my brief stay in Redmond including the friends whose name I've forgotten that made me no bake cookies (which recipe I remember to this day) because I broke out in hives because I was allergic to eggs. To Mark, my first best friend when we moved to that tiny house in Newport where I lived in the sun room behind my sisters' tiny bedroom, and I was just a poor kid with nothing, who moved to England and I've never seen again. To the friends I met in special education and in honors through my entire schooling system. To Mr Shaver who made me and the smartest girl in class tie a spelling bee because we forgot to capitalize the H I'm Hawai'i. He didn't tell us about the apostrophe and gave me my first opportunity to play a video game, Duck Hunt. To Mrs Cisero who gave me extra homework in maths and taught me Algebra in 4th grade. Who bought the companion book to Sideways Stories by Wayside School which showed me how to add words and gave me the ability to think abstractly about math. To Mr Vaughn (I get his name mixed up with Mr Shaver) who taught me Spanish and took me to a Math Is Cool competition where I got my first trophy for placing 13th out of all the 5th and 6th graders in Washington and Oregon for my marks on the personal exam. To my friends who came with me to that tournament. To the judges who were completely astounded that I answered the (irrelevant) tie breaker question after our school got eliminated. (Side story: What is 1+2. My have was on the rope by the time they said 2. I had solved Gauss's formula at age 7 sitting in the bathroom staring at my eyes in the mirror. I had just solved tic-tac-toe and wanted to do something harder. I waited until they paused after 10. I didn't know if they were going to stop at 10 or 11. 55! The entire rooms eyes we on me. The Newport Miner put me in the paper. That was when I knew I was very different. I didn't want to be seen, so I hid after that. Always the wallflower, I stayed back and wondered why no one seemed to be aware of themselves or their actions. So I watched and observed.) To Mr Gee who taught me about bridges and watersheds and showed me how to think like a scientist and let me explore the unique way my brain processes information. To Jolene, Farren, and the rest of my Cub Scout and Boy Schout troop leaders who taught me honor, courage, strength, compassion, grit, determination, honesty. A scout is: Trustworthy Loyal Helpful Courteous Kind Obedient Cheerful Thrifty Brave Clean And Reverent On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight. To my church leaders who taught me how to apply those lessons and let me continue to explore and learn about myself through scripture reading and memorization tactics and to respect all humans as equal no matter their background or beliefs or physical or mental traits. To the friends I met in church who reached out and saw the pain I was in growing up and let me be my emotional, nerdy, extremely odd self and loved and supported me through it and let me be a normal kid in a world that was not. To the rest of my teachers in Newport who taught me so many life lessons that stick with me to this day. To my music teachers who instilled in me a love of music by teaching me flute, piano, and guitar even though I want good at any of them! Especially to Ian and Andrew who let me join their duo and we became the trio. I won't even try to go into our escapades, but I treasure every camping trip, every firework experiment, every competition, and every single time I was able to be my authentic self. To the friends I made in Cusick who let the nerd from Newport crash there for a while; who taught me what the world outside my sheltered life looked like, and who came with me to state in the Envirathon after we beat My friends in Newport at regionals. (Sorry I didn't know all the trees in Vancouver (Washington). Eastern Washington trees are so much more interesting. Lol.) To my teachers at Cusick who fast tracked my math and English education, and let me replace classes I clearly didn't need (11th grade English) for an alternative class where I learned an extremely useful skill (how to orate). To Mr Pease who took on the challenge of teaching gym and Biology because the school was so tiny, and taught me to appreciate every single sport. Lacrosse,. Floor hockey. Lifting. That silly game he made up which was a cross between football and American football. Football. Basketball. To all the friends I've met on the court who let me play center even though I was a foot too short for the position because they knew I would always fight tooth and nail for those rebounds even though I really, really couldn't shoot but I could grab 20 defensive rebounds and 30 offensive rebounds (mostly repeated kisses at the rim.) To Mr Brown who pushed me to learn as much math as possible in as short a time as possible to catch me up to where I should be and made sure I didn't fall behind after changing schools in the middle of high school, who gave me a desire to join the Navy. To James who left me crash on his couch while I was homeless and watched inordinate amounts of Kobe and Jordan and LeBron, who was one of the many friends and family who have taken me in when I had nowhere else to go. To my teachers in Pocatello who took me under their arms and encouraged me to go on to college and let me replace English for a mythology course, again inspiring me to think outside the box about language. To Mr Edwards who showed me the ropes for physics and challenged me to be better than the best and ""burn the midnight oil"" as he eloquently said in my college recommendation letter. To Mr Christianson who taught me Calculus and broke my egg drop experiment when he broke my Nalgene bottle sitting in his office chair! To the choir kids who let me join their group of hooligans. Especially to Jesse, who saw a nerdy kid drinking water out of a fountain singing Lincoln Park and joined in making us best friends for life. All the golf, basketball, track and field, cross country, billiards, bowling, and freaking ping pong we did together, him challenging me to be faster and stronger, me challenging him to push harder and work longer. To every one of my employers who have taught me so many life skills. Farming, ranching, cooking, teaching, excavation, road building, land and house flipping, roofing, fencing, mechanics, census work, math, physics, research, robotics, machine learning, programming, and so many life lessons. To my dear friends I met in Taiwan on my mission, who took me in and treated me like family, who are some of the kindest humans you will ever meet. In Kaohsiung, Dong Gang, Ren De, Gui Ren, and especially Tainan where I spent an entire year with the 3rd ward and 5th branch. That chapel became my second home. To my Mission Training Center teachers who named me ""Preach Fellowship and Universal Love"" in Mandarin. To my mission companions who are some of the most incredible people I've met, especially the nerds who went through the MTC with me as we learned one of the most beautiful languages in the world. To my mission president, President Hsu who put incredible amount of trust in me and was my personal mentor before he passed away. To his beautiful wife who to this day is a mother to all of us. To my teachers at Idaho State University who put up with me for way too many years. To Dr Steve, who I can just call Steve now because I became a physicist when I got my degree in physics and we were equals. To Dr Dale who put up with me through way too many courses from electronics to nuclear physics and somehow kept a straight face while the whole class was googling under their breaths when we said stupid things in class, and always had a good one liner ready. ""Here's the punchline, now you can go to sleep."" ""Take the integral of potato d potato."" To Dr Stowe who gave the most detailed feedback and spent every extra effort to connect with his pupils individually. To Dr Chen who was a robot. Who never made a mistake in his maths, expected nothing but perfection, who taught me almost everything I know about algebra, and made sure every lesson stuck by having the most unique homeworks and tests. Who put up with me in grad school as my mental health deteriorated. To Dr Fisher who was the best advisor and chair anyone could ever ask for, who always had time for students and was a walking encyclopedia for maths. To Dr Gryazin who let me take courses and their prerequisites at the same time and never gave me a 100% on an exam. Always 99%! To Ms Donvan for teaching me English, Literature, and Art if the Film and brought me down to Earth by always giving me a B, and who encouraged me to use University resources to help me with my disabilities and to not be afraid to ask for help. To Dr Green who taught me economics and introduced me to the wonderful world of game theory. To Dr Bennett who encouraged me to expand my knowledge of physics to include chemistry and taught me differential equations long before I took that class, who encouraged me to try to get 3 degrees in college even though I finally chose physics over chemistry. To so many more professors that deserve so much more recognition for their work, who get paid squat compared to what they're worth. To my professors at South Dakota School of Mines who gave me the space I needed to heal as my mental health went to rock bottom and were some of the people I kept thinking about as I attempted suicide, leading to me calling and asking for help. To the wonderful volunteers who answer so many calls on suicide prevention hotlines. Especially to the workers at the veteran's suicide hotline who have saved my life on multiple occasions. To Drs Petukhov and Oswaldowki and Sobelev who allowed me to blossom into the scientist I am today. To the rest of my professors at SDSMT, especially the ones who helped me perfect my incredibly spicy chili and rekindled my joy of cooking as well as taught me the secrets of the universe. To the friends I met in Rapid City and Pocatello who I don't stay near close enough. I remember you and the fun we had. I cannot possibly name you all. To the Physics Lounge and the deep bond we've made over the years of shared pain and agony over learning some of the most difficult material from some of the best professors in this country. No, I'm not exaggerating. To the wonderful coworkers I met working in wilderness therapy who helped me finish the healing process of my mental health journey by reminding me who I am spiritually. To every single one of my students at ISU, SDSMT, in the wilderness, and through tutoring. I remember all of your work, and I was always extremely exacting in my expectations but so many of them rose to the challenge and learned to love maths and science the way I do, with a childhood curiosity and exuberance. To every bartender, barista, and shop owner who has let me sit and talk politics and philosophy and maths and physics and philosophy and psychology. To every random person I've met along the way. To my past relationships and the deep bonds we shared through the good times and through the pain, who stuck with me as I pushed them all away for fear of letting my unresolved mental health issues affect them. To my beautiful children who are beyond brilliant and are the driving force for so much of what I do, who will be Iron Man and Spiderman if we can fix this mess if a world so they can blossom into the engineers or scientists or whatever they decide to grow up to be. These are the people in my life, in tiny communities where few people know their names. These are the lifeblood of America along with every single one of you and every one of your stories. Our strength is in our People. We must realize that we are the cavalry. No one is coming to save us. No one is going to get corruption out of our government, save the environment, end poverty and homeless, cure stigma, or solve the deep divides in our country that lead to children being murdered, people being murdered at theaters and malls and clubs,  racism, sexism, and being unaccepting and discriminating against people who have different sexual preferences than the social norms allows. When did we forget the lessons our parents, ancestors, teachers, preachers, and leaders taught us? We are doomed to repeat history if we do not have a moral revival in this country. What happened to faith, hope, charity, love, honesty, and humility? This is going to take every single American to fix, and the fighting across the aisle, between friends and family, and through our community needs to stop. Now. Yesterday. And I'm asking you, Montana, and the rest of America to wake up, look around you, and tell me how we're going to fix this. It's time for solutions. . .

Mike Knoles for Senate,,2020-02-05 15:32:50,"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic’s success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of Congress for these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other’s good faith. The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a Senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise “impartial justice.” I am a profoundly religious person. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the President, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong. The House Managers presented evidence supporting their case; the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the President’s team presented three defenses: first, that there can be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that the Bidens’ conduct justified the President’s actions; and third that the judgement of the President’s actions should be left to the voters. Let me first address each of those defenses. The historic meaning of the words “high crimes and misdemeanors,” the writings of the Founders and my own reasoned judgement convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove a president defies reason. The President’s counsel noted that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian Prosecutor General. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong. With regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father’s name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the President’s counsel that a crime had been committed, the President’s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There is no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the President would never have done what he did. The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution’s requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the Founders’ decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to voters was intended to minimize—to the extent possible—the partisan sentiments of the public. This verdict is ours to render. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfilled our duty. The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a “high crime and misdemeanor.” Yes, he did. The President asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The President withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The President delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The President’s purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the President is guilty of an appalling abuse of the public trust. What he did was not “perfect”— No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security interests, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine. In the last several weeks, I have received numerous calls and texts. Many demand that, in their words, “I stand with the team.” I can assure you that that thought has been very much on my mind. I support a great deal of what the President has done. I have voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and biases aside. Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented, and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history’s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience. I am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced. I am sure to hear abuse from the President and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me? I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he said might raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment. Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I am convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We have come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience. I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the President from office. The results of this Senate Court will in fact be appealed to a higher court: the judgement of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the President’s lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me. I will only be one name among many, no more or less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the President did was wrong, grievously wrong. We’re all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that is distinction enough for any citizen. -Mitt Romney-",,,,,,,,,135810704576449,/story.php?story_fbid=135810704576449&id=107447304079456

"Mike Knoles for Senate,Montana Press Monthly",Montana Press Monthly,2020-01-02 17:46:46,"“The gold mono-metalists cannot gain any help from the history of civilization. They never point out an example where the free coinage of silver drove gold out of the country. No fair example can be found in all history. Nor can a case be given where a leading nation ever coined both metals at a higher ratio than 16 to 1. The whole argument of the ‘sound money’ gentlemen, is as Senator Cockrell says, founded ‘on a prophecy, a threat, a prediction.’ The same prediction was made when the Bland bill became a law. But within the next twelve years the amount of gold increased from 140 to 340 million. The ‘sound money’ men simply say that this nation cannot maintain the free coinage and circulation of both metals. How do they know? That is what the white men said to the negro when he undertook to eat the watermelon. ‘You can’t,’ he said: but he did. That is what the Torries said to George Washington and the Revolutionary patriots when they undertook to whip England: but they did it. The United States can.  Uncle Sam says I can, and Brother Jonathan says ‘I’ll try, sir.’ Americans are not inclined to shrink from anything on the theory that their nation is too weak and cannot. That argument is worth nothing. The gold bugs are not winning anything by it.  They must show that it will not be good for America to have free and unlimited coinage of silver.  This has not been shown, and all attempts at it simply amount to predictions and threats.” The Big Timber Pioneer  January 2, 1896",1,1,,,,,,,124355809055272,/story.php?story_fbid=124355809055272&id=107447304079456
