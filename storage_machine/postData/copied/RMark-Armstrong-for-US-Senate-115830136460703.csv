R.Mark Armstrong for US Senate,,2020-03-10 02:52:49,"It is with a heavy heart that i had to file an election violation complaint.   This is the text of the email that was with the complaint. Julie, Thank you for your patience!  Attached please find the; Complaint form that is signed by myself (PDF), the poster promoting the Lincoln Day Dinner and Cynthia Lummis (JPEG), and a PM on FB from Pepper the Fremont County GOP chairman (JPEG). At the Lincoln Dinner in Cheyenne I was able to speak with Josh Wheeler, Short and Miller.  All agreed that Fremont County GOP should not be able to advertise and promote Cynthia Lummis as Key note speaker in this the Primary season.  Cynthia announced she was running for Senate in or before September 2019.   I sent a letter to the GOP in September 2019 and announced in September 2019. The Law States: 22-25-104  No political party funds shall be expended directly or indirectly in the aid of the nomination of any one person as against another person of the same political party running in the primary election. The poster (Attachment 1) was distributed by the Fremont party.  Funds were spent to make the poster and Cynthia as key note speaker is being given 15 minutes to talk while all other candidates are given 2 minutes.  Funds are being spent directly and indirectly by Fremont County GOP to endorse and promote Cynthia Lummis and her campaign against all other candidates running.  This is damaging all other campaigns.  If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call  or email me. Sincerely, R. Mark Armstrong for US Senate 307-399-8516 PS:  Mark Klaassen; Please monitor this situation to make sure the law is followed.  As you know I will fight for Justice for all!   SOS Kip stated we are not in the Primary even though at least 4 candidates have declared they are running. The US Attorney has forwarded the complaint to the election integrity coordinator!",2,2,,,,,,,214658563244526,/story.php?story_fbid=214658563244526&id=115830136460703

R.Mark Armstrong for US Senate,,2020-02-18 07:57:20,"In Paul's letter to Titus, Paul quota's the pagan unbeliever Epimenides, a Cretan philosopher.      ""Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."".  So I ask are DC swamp dwellers Cretans?  Lazy Gluttons.  If so we must change  the status quo.   Can we implement zero sum performance based  budgeting?  Yes i know it will be difficult to administer.  Mike Enzi's recently proposed legislation is a first step. Can we re write and amend  NEPA? Can we get big money and corruption out of politics? Can we get the Federal Government back inside the Constitution?  Can we?",1,1,,,,,,,198963934813989,/story.php?story_fbid=198963934813989&id=115830136460703
