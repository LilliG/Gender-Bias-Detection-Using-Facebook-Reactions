"Doug Jones for Senate,The Valley Weekly",The Valley Weekly,2019-12-11 14:05:44,"Doug's bill to secure permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities is one step further to becoming law. Oakwood University President Dr. Leslie Pollard took some time to explain what that means for HBCUs like Oakwood in Alabama.Alabama HBCUs Have a Champion in Senator Jones By: Dr. Leslie Pollard, President of Oakwood University, Huntsville, AL Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Alabama are central to our culture, our economy and the future of our young people and our state. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important that our schools get the funding they need to continue educating students and guiding them into the world with intelligence, respect and honesty. As the President of Oakwood University, I know firsthand the joys and challenges of guiding students through higher education and into the next phase of their lives. Whether it‚Äôs the first step on the path to higher learning or a student returning to school to expand their horizons, Oakwood University is home to students of many ages, backgrounds and beliefs who come to Oakwood to better themselves and their communities. Since September 30, funding for HBCUs in Alabama and across the country has been uncertain since the Senate failed to renew $255 million in federal funding for these schools. Fortunately, last week I received a personal call from our very own U.S. Senator Doug Jones that the Senate passed a bill that will permanently provide annual funding to Oakwood University and HBCUs across the country. This breakthrough legislation represents a huge relief for minority-serving schools across the country that rely on this federal funding to educate our students for the future. Senator Jones‚Äô bill, the FUTURE Act, will ensure that the Title III program, which provides funding for Oakwood University, remains funded by Congress. Along with school funding, legislation was also approved that will simplify the FAFSA application for prospective college students. This fix will help streamline the federal aid application process for students and their families and help students get the aid they need to obtain a higher education and hopefully reduce their debt upon graduating. And the beneficiary of much of this work will be our state of Alabama‚Äôs with its growing and diversified workforce. HBCUs like Oakwood University are leaders in educating students of color and lifting up generations of underserved communities. I‚Äôm extremely proud we have a champion in Senator Jones who was able to engineer bipartisan support for minority-serving institutions in Alabama and across the country.",183,167,1,15,,,,7,1077547695941270,/story.php?story_fbid=1077547695941270&id=429812024048177

Doug Jones for Senate,,2019-10-25 14:16:23,"It‚Äôs Magic City Classic week, y‚Äôall, which is a perfect time to remind everyone of the huge impact HBCUs have here in Alabama and across the country.  HBCUs are responsible for 60% of engineering degrees for black students -- 70% of black dentists and physicians earned degrees at HBCUs and HBCUs have trained around 50% of black teachers. Experts estimate HBCUs in Alabama alone add $1.5 billion to our economy.  Tuskegee University is the only HBCU with a College of Veterinary Medicine, A&M is the only 1890 land grant university offering four Ph.D. programs, ASU houses the National Center for the Study of Civil Rights and African American Culture. All of this makes it clear: our HBCUs are absolutely vital. But they‚Äôre also underfunded, and future funding is at risk.  Reports estimate that 46% of all HBCU buildings are in need of repair or replacement.  Not a single one of the over 100 institutions of higher education in the country with endowments greater than $1 billion is an HBCU. Research has found that the average endowment of an HBCU is half the size of similar schools that are not HBCUs. That is why funding is critical. The Senate must vote on Doug‚Äôs FUTURE Act‚Äî which would extend HBCU funding through the next fiscal year. Doug has also introduced legislation to raise and extend funding for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions permanently. These schools are part of the very foundation of our higher education system and our state. Doug won't stop working to support them.",529,454,1,70,3,,1,9,1034913863537987,/story.php?story_fbid=1034913863537987&id=429812024048177

Doug Jones for Senate,,2019-08-31 15:41:21,"The Senator‚Äôs message on Governor Kay Ivey‚Äôs blackface skit:  There is a long and painful history associated with blackface in our country. It has been used to demean and dehumanize African Americans and there is absolutely no excuse for it. I appreciate the way Governor Ivey has addressed this in a straightforward manner.  Accepting responsibility while apologizing and expressing remorse are important ways to move beyond our mistakes. However, as you look around today, we still see marginalized communities and racial disparities in almost every facet of Alabamian life and it is painfully obvious that we have never fully reckoned with the issues of race that continue to divide us. In fact, they are often ignored. So in my view the most significant thing Gov. Ivey said was this: ‚ÄúI will do all I can ‚Äì going forward ‚Äì to help show the nation that the Alabama of today is a far cry from the Alabama of the 1960s. We have come a long way, for sure, but we still have a long way to go.‚Äù  While what she did in college was offensive, that would pale in comparison to the pain and injustice that would be caused now and tomorrow from not meaningfully following through on her own promise to the state and, especially the African-American community.

Doug Jones for Senate,,2019-08-31 15:41:21,"The Senator‚Äôs message on Governor Kay Ivey‚Äôs blackface skit:  There is a long and painful history associated with blackface in our country. It has been used to demean and dehumanize African Americans and there is absolutely no excuse for it. I appreciate the way Governor Ivey has addressed this in a straightforward manner.  Accepting responsibility while apologizing and expressing remorse are important ways to move beyond our mistakes. However, as you look around today, we still see marginalized communities and racial disparities in almost every facet of Alabamian life and it is painfully obvious that we have never fully reckoned with the issues of race that continue to divide us. In fact, they are often ignored. So in my view the most significant thing Gov. Ivey said was this: ‚ÄúI will do all I can ‚Äì going forward ‚Äì to help show the nation that the Alabama of today is a far cry from the Alabama of the 1960s. We have come a long way, for sure, but we still have a long way to go.‚Äù  While what she did in college was offensive, that would pale in comparison to the pain and injustice that would be caused now and tomorrow from not meaningfully following through on her own promise to the state and, especially the African-American community.  So let‚Äôs take action on what that promise means rather than let the words slip away.",530,407,,34,10,7,72,97,991847254511315,/story.php?story_fbid=991847254511315&id=429812024048177
