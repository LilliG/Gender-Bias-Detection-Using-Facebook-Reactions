"David Weikle for US Senate,Laird Minor",,2020-04-08 18:24:15,"So, about those decrees from Foghorn Leghorn...The General Assembly held a special one-day session today to pass a Continuing Resolution to keep the state government functioning during the COVID-19 emergency, and to handle some administrative matters concerning the use of federal disaster relief relating to it. (The Senate is also dealing with a few uncontested appointments.) The House passed the CR an hour or two ago and adjourned. The Senate remains in session, but undoubtedly will pass it too.  What matters to me is that neither chamber has taken up the issue of Governor McMaster's ""State of Emergency"" declaration, or the numerous Executive Orders which flowed from it. As I have previously pointed out, SC Code §25-1-440(a)(2) authorizes the Governor to ""declare a state of emergency for all or part of the State if he finds a disaster or a public health emergency, as defined in Section 44-4-130, has occurred, or that the threat thereof is imminent and extraordinary measures are considered necessary to cope with the existing or anticipated situation. A declared state of emergency shall not continue for a period of more than fifteen days without the consent of the General Assembly.""  That declaration occurred on March 13. Its statutory 15-day life span expired on March 29. Since the General Assembly has not ratified his orders, or otherwise dealt with any of the matters they contained, in my opinion all such Executive Orders are now void.",9,9,,,,,,,1275078239502160,/story.php?story_fbid=1275078239502160&id=638871776456146

"David Weikle for US Senate,Amanda Hill",,2020-04-07 12:47:10,"A Facebook friend of mine just did an antibody test for Covid-19. He was brutally ill with some kind of weird virus the week of Christmas. The test was positive for the presence of antibodies to Covid-19. He’s already had it.  Some will say that there’s no proof he has it in December and that it’s more likely he was asymptomatic in the last 4-5 weeks. That is highly unlikely. His wife has, in the last several weeks been undergoing cancer treatments, and her immune system is very fragile right now. If he was an asymptomatic carrier in the last 4-5 weeks, it’s highly likely she would be deathly ill with Covid-19 right now. The models are wrong because they don’t take into consideration the fact that the virus was here since November. We’re flattening the curve with herd immunity. Because the immune system is more awesome than Dr. Fauci. I’m going to say it again for those in the back: End the shutdown. Dennis Cockrell I did not anticipate this post going so far.

Shutting down the country while it may be the most impactful thing to do to regarding ""flattening the curve"", that may not be the best thing to do.

"David Weikle for US Senate,Rachel Nielsen",,2020-04-01 08:00:37,"The virus is real. The response from governments is overblown and has great potential to do more damage. Voluntary Action > Government ForceAn update to the madness:  According to the Johns Hopkins tracking tool we have 16 confirmed positives in my county. The CDC reports 14. We actually have 16, and they’re all at the hospital I work for. 11 of them are critically ill and on mechanical ventilators. The rest of the hospital is largely empty by design to prevent the spread to other patients.  We’re still rationing and reusing masks, but this week our administrators have decided we may use the fabric masks the community has spent so much time sewing for us. They are not, however, handing them out. Megan’s mom made me a half dozen and I’m disseminating them to my housekeepers who are only being given paper masks.  Because the federal government outbid the states for masks and other protective gear we are reusing it until it’s grossly soiled or falls off of us. We will run out of isolation gowns in 2 days but have a planned delivery of those. The masks are a different story and there’s no estimation when we will get more.  All of these patients are in negative pressure isolation, which means there is continuous air exchange and it’s vented outdoors. They’re also cohorted which means previously private rooms are now shared between people with the same infectious diseases.  My peri-op department is now housing non-infected ICU, not because the ICU is full but to keep these patients away from the COVID patients. These patients are very sick and on mechanical ventilators too, just for different reasons. We’re still only performing emergent surgeries and there’s no estimation when we will see elective patients again. My surgeons and anesthesiologists are barely working.  Last week we were encouraged to check our temperature twice daily. Now there is a table inside the single open employee entrance where we’re shunted like cattle into line to have our temperatures checked and get a sticker with today’s date on it that must be displayed on our badges while we’re in the hospital. I take Zyrtec daily to combat sinus drainage and itchy throat because if someone coughs around here it causes a panic.  In my community a lot of things are less locked down than in your urban centers. We aren’t on mandatory curfew but most of the valley is self-isolating. Our non-essential businesses are closed, school is over for the year, our public park bathrooms and trails are closed, there are no department stores or salons open. Restaurants serve take-out only and in some cases will sell you some of their raw ingredients if the groceries are empty.

David Weikle for US Senate,,2020-03-03 10:58:37,"Bernie Sanders is the man to beat this #SuperThursday... according to Joe Biden who seems to have gotten the nod from the DNC with 2 competitors dropping out in the last 48 hours and endorsing him for #SuperTuesday. Heck, they even got #BetaBeto to pull up and endorse him. I'm not sure someone with obvious signs of dementia is who you want going toe-to-toe with the King of the Trolls, but hey -- it should make things interesting at the very least. My guess is that Democrats are probably headed to a contested convention in Milwaukee while Trump strolls back in to his nomination from the Republicans in Charlotte. I'm hoping that the Libertarians nominate someone who stands out -- especially as they gain support from disaffected Democrats and Republicans. On a more important note: Lyman Bishop is running to be the governor of Montana. If you like me and my views on the natural right to keep and bear arms, go check him out and consider supporting him in whatever way you can. Semper Fidelis!

David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-12-25 09:23:08,"""And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.""

David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-11-06 10:04:02,"I mourn the loss of life due to the actions of truly terrible people. I mourn the dead who got caught up in a battle between two drug cartels. But the answer going forward is not to use American military force to fight a bunch well armed gangsters who have already shown a willingness and ability to use force against the government forces of Mexico, let alone foreign fighters. Even if we are invited into Mexico,  we should not use military force. What we should do is kill the cartels by destroying their business model by finally ending the drug war. Prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s resulted in many pointless deaths. Violence from Prohibition in the 21st century is far more gruesome and it will not let up. If the cartels can't make money by selling drugs, they will have to adapt or die. Destroying the black market for drugs by making everything legal will allow free market competition that will benefit everyone, including those of us who have no desire to use recreational substances. This is the safest path forward and it won't cost taxpayers any money, in fact it will save us money!

Every boojahideen's favorite candidate for 2020, Potato O'Rourke (@betoorourke),  is continuing to be the lead in the Democrat gun control debate. From the Washington examiner: 'O'Rourke claimed those who brandish their weapons will face legal action, but most, he believes, will be turned over from Americans. ""If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public to brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement,"" said O'Rourke. He continued, ""But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country.

David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-10-11 10:07:38,"Freedom Friday! Weapons as Political Protest: P.A. Luty’s Submachine Gun August 2, 2017 Ian McCollum ""Phillip A. Luty was a Briton who took a hard philosophical line against gun control legislation in the UK in the 1990s. In response to more restrictive gun control laws, he set out to prove that all such laws were ultimately futile by showing that one could manufacture a functional firearm from hardware store goods, without using any purpose-made firearms parts. Luty succeeded in this task, designing a 9mm submachine gun made completely from scratch with a minimum of tools. In 1998, he published the plans for his gun as the book “Expedient Homemade Firearms”. Luty was not particularly discreet about his activities (actually, he was quite outspoken…) and was eventually caught by the police while out to test fire one of his guns, and arrested. He was convicted, and spent several years in prison. He continued to pursue a gun rights agenda after being released, and was facing legal trouble again when he passed away form cancer in 2011."" -@forgottenweapons . . . . . #MakeMachineGunsGreatAgain #MMGGA #RepealBrady #RepealHughes #RepealTheNFA #AbolishTheATF #AbolishGunFreeZones #ShallNotBeInfringed #FullFunFreedom #PewPew #Boogaloo2020 #Weikle2020 #Boojahideen #ar15 #ak47boyz #LetThemEatLead #CultOfStoner #KalashKultists #SendBachelors #EndTheForeverWar #EndTheDrugWar #EndTheFed #RepealThe16th #TaxationIsTheft #EndFiatCurrency #RepealThe17th #Decentralization #Localization #Republican #Libertarian",55,38,,17,,,,,1093212094355443,/story.php?story_fbid=1093212094355443&id=638871776456146

David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-10-02 09:51:42,"I'm David Weikle, candidate for U.S. Senate. In the spirit of 1776 I want to discuss an important topic for all Americans: secession. We as a nation have a lengthy history with secession. 243 years ago the Declaration of Independence was signed by John Hancock, the President of the Continental Congress. It served as an instrument of secession. ""When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."" We fought a civil war in the 1860s because 13 States tried to leave the Union. Our own state of South Carolina lost nearly a third of the white, fighting age men. South Carolina tried to leave peacefully at first. The War Between the States began with Battle of Fort Sumter on April 12th, 1861 and it lead to the bloodiest war in our nation's history. That same year counties in Virginia seceded from their own state and attempted to rejoin the Union. West Virginia was peacefully admitted to Union on June 20, 1863. What was the difference between South Carolina and West Virginia? We have to turn a Supreme Court case from April 12th, 1869 : Texas vs. White. In a 5-3 decision, Chief Justice Salmon Chase wrote that the original Union of the colonies had been made in reaction to the circumstances faced by the colonists. He argued that the Articles of Confederation created a perpetual union between these States. The Constitution, when it was implemented, only strengthened and perfected this perpetual relationship. ""The Union of the States never was a purely artificial and arbitrary relation. It began among the Colonies, and grew out of common origin, mutual sympathies, kindred principles, similar interests, and geographical relations. It was confirmed and strengthened by the necessities of war, and received definite form and character and sanction from the Articles of Confederation. By these, the Union was solemnly declared to ""be perpetual"". And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained ""to form a more perfect Union"". It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not?"" Chase went on to address Texas' relationship to that Union. He rejected the notion that Texas had merely created a compact with the other states; rather, he said it had in fact incorporated itself into an already existing indissoluble political body. ""When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States."" Salmon Chase laid out the groundwork for peaceful political divorce from the United States of America. Secession is possible in the United States of America through revolution or through consent of the States. The States did not consent South Carolina to leaving the Union. They did consent to the splitting of Virginia and the formation of West Virginia. Why is this relevant today? Because there is a modern day secession movement in the United States of America. I'm talking about Yes, California. I'm talking about CalExit. Think about California and how California politics effect you. Because of California we have to worry about gun grabbers like Diane Feinstein or Nancy Pelosi. Imagine a world where Californians vote to leave the United States and become an independent nation. What would that do for federal politics? First, we won't have to deal with crazy far left wackadoodle politicians from California. Secondly a lot liberal people might leave conservative States in order to get the government that they want. Everyone wins! Finally it will put the federal government on notice. The federal bureaucracies will have to actually work to continue to receive the ""consent of the governed."" I think the people of California have the right to control their political destiny. And I will vote in the U.S. Senate to respect their wishes to stay or go, with some basic conditions. First, I think that the vote should be held statewide. Everyone should have the opportunity to vote. Secondly, I think that the Apportionment act of 1929 should be repealed for more accurate representation of all Americans in the U.S. House of Representatives. Returning to the Article 1, Section, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution would have 1 Representative for every 30,000 citizens. Third I feel that the decision to stay or go should ultimately be decided on a small scale, on at least a county by county basis or perhaps by congressional districts, with those districts representing no more than 30,000 citizens. It is not an all or nothing decision. That would not be fair to Californians in rural counties that want to stay in the United States, nor would it be fair to coastal Californians if they want to leave. I don't get to decide California's future. That is up to the people of California. We as Americans should respect their wishes, whether it is to stay or to go. What are your thoughts? Should California have it's own Independence Day? Can we all get behind the idea of making the federal government more responsive to the States and the People? I'm David Weikle, candidate for U.S. Senate. Thank you and God bless!",40,24,2,13,1,,,,1084580491885270,/story.php?story_fbid=1084580491885270&id=638871776456146

If @realdonaldtrump wants gun control you know that he can, at the stroke of pen, violate your natural right to keep and bear arms. Remember bumpstocks? Those were retroactively classified as machine guns and hence illegal for civilian ownership if they were not registered as such before May of 1986. I've said it before and I'll say it again, @thedemocrats scream for gun control but it takes the @gop to pass it.

David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-08-29 20:18:55,"I'm David Weikle, candidate for U.S. Senate. In the spirit of 1776 I want to discuss an important topic for all Americans: #Secession. We as a nation have a lengthy history with secession. 243 years ago the Declaration of Independence was signed by members of the Continental Congress. It served as an instrument of secession. ""When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."" We fought a civil war in the 1860s because 13 States tried to leave the Union. South Carolina tried to leave peacefully at first. The War Between the States began with Battle of Fort Sumter on April 12th, 1861 and it lead to the bloodiest war in our nation's history. That same year counties in Virginia seceded from their own state and attempted to rejoin the Union. West Virginia was peacefully admitted to Union on June 20, 1863. What was the difference between South Carolina and West Virginia? We have to turn a Supreme Court case from April 12th, 1869 : Texas vs. White. In a 5-3 decision, Chief Justice Salmon Chase wrote that the original Union of the colonies had been made in reaction to the circumstances faced by the colonists. He argued that the Articles of Confederation created a perpetual union between these States. The Constitution, when it was implemented, only strengthened and perfected this perpetual relationship. Chase went on to address Texas' relationship to that Union. He rejected the notion that Texas had merely created a compact with the other states; rather, he said it had in fact incorporated itself into an already existing indissoluble political body. Salmon Chase laid out the groundwork for peaceful political divorce from the United States of America. Secession is possible through revolution or through consent of the States. The States did not consent to South Carolina leaving the Union. They did consent to the splitting of Virginia and the formation of West Virginia. Why is this relevant today? Because there is a modern day secession movement in the U.S. I'm talking about Yes, California. I'm talking about #CalExit. Think about California and how California politics effect you. Because of California we have to worry about gun grabbers like Diane Feinstein or Nancy Pelosi. Imagine a world where Californians vote to leave the United States and become an independent nation. What would that do for federal politics? First, we won't have to deal with crazy far left politicians from California. Secondly a lot liberal people might leave conservative States in order to get the government that they want. Everyone wins! Finally it will put the federal government on notice. The federal bureaucracies will have to actually work to continue to receive the ""consent of the governed."" I think the people of California have the right to control their political destiny. And I will vote in the U.S. Senate to respect their wishes to stay or go, with some basic conditions. First, I think that the vote should be held statewide. Everyone should have the opportunity to vote. Second, I think that the Apportionment Act of 1929 should be repealed for a more accurate representation of all Americans in the U.S. House of Representatives. Returning to the proportion found in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution would have 1 Representative for every 30,000 citizens. Third I feel that the decision to stay or go should ultimately be decided on a small scale, on at least a county by county basis or perhaps by congressional districts, with those districts representing no more than 30,000 citizens. It is not an all or nothing decision. That would not be fair to Californians in rural counties that want to stay in the United States, nor would it be fair to coastal Californians if they want to leave. I don't get to decide California's future. That is up to the people of California. We as Americans should respect their wishes, whether it is to stay or to go. What are your thoughts? Should California have it's own Independence Day? Can we all get behind the idea of making the federal government more responsive to the States and the People? I'm David Weikle, candidate for U.S. Senate. Thank you and God bless!",43,37,,6,,,,,1053967651613221,/story.php?story_fbid=1053967651613221&id=638871776456146

The Second Amendment does not grant anyone the right to keep and bear arms, it recognizes the natural right and was meant to preserve it from the choking tentacles of government. The recent tragedies in Texas and Ohio would not have been prevented by passing more gun laws that infringe on the natural right of self-defense. We already have too many laws om the books, one more will not stop the next shooting, the next murder or the next suicide -- because it is already illegal to go on a shooting spree; it is already illegal to murder; and suicide is still illegal in most places. When we pass laws they only affect the law abiding.  Criminals will continue to commit criminal acts. Governments has spent over a trillion dollars waging the War on Drugs. How are gun bans going to be any easier? If gun bans will stop the violence how did drug users get cannabis in the decades after it became illegal on the federal level? We don't need more gun control, we need more individual liberty. #MakeMachineGunsGreatAgain #EndTheDrugWar #RepealTheNFA #EndTheForeverWar #RepealHughes #TaxationIsTheft #RepealBrady #EndTheFed #AbolishTheATF #RepealThe16th #BlackGunsMatter #AbolishTheIRS",133,105,3,25,,,,,1032789207064399,/story.php?story_fbid=1032789207064399&id=638871776456146
David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-08-01 15:09:43,"The Battle of Athens was waged 73 years ago today on August 1, 1946. Veterans of the Second World War took up arms against corrupt government officials who sought to fix the election. Those men were able to protect the democratic process by exercising the natural right to keep and bear arms. From the article: ""In the summer of 1946, war-weary GIs began to return from World War II battlefronts in Europe and Japan, ready to resume life in their sleepy Tennessee town. What they found, instead, infuriated them to the core. A power-hungry Democrat and his associates had since usurped local government and law enforcement, and had imposed a maniacal chokehold on the McMinn County town through extortive fines, excess laws, and arrests of anyone who opposed them. While the soldiers were away fighting power-hungry foreign enemies in 1936, Paul Cantrell, a Democrat from a wealthy and prominent family, used that influence to win the position of sheriff. Though many Athens citizens strongly suspected Cantrell hadn’t been elected through entirely legal means, there appeared to be no way to challenge the results. As the years passed, Cantrell and his deputies took full advantage of Tennessee law which gave the unscrupulous men a fee for each person arrested, jailed, and released. According to some accounts, the lawmen even pulled over buses that happened to pass through town, summarily arrested everyone on board for drunkenness — whether or not they actually were — in order to profit handily from their misfortune. But such arrests and fines required paperwork — which meant traceable money — and to some degree hindered the men’s ability to rake in cash.""",91,64,,23,4,,,,1029543860722267,/story.php?story_fbid=1029543860722267&id=638871776456146

In an effort to keep that from happening, I am seeking the Republican nomination for the US Senate in 2020 to DETHRONE Lindsey Graham. It’s time to stop being on the defensive when it comes to your right to keep and bear arms.  It’s time to #MakeMachineGunsGreatAgain.  I am the Anti-Graham.  And I'm asking for your help now, so you’re not stuck with Graham in the general election. I need your help in two ways: 1. Please share this post with your friends to help spread the message of #theAntiGraham. 2. Please make a donation at http://www.davidweikle.com. No amount is too small, and every single penny of your contributions will be weaponized against Graham. We CAN win this fight. And we WILL win with your help. Semper Fidelis!

David Weikle for US Senate,,2019-07-06 12:59:46,"""One of the long-shot candidates hoping to replace U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham in next year’s Republican primary is promoting a 2020 slogan with firepower. “Make Machine Guns Great Again,” Second Amendment backer and Marine veteran David Weikle of North Augusta says in a social media hashtag he’s promoting."" -- Schuyler Kropf I'm not a ""Second Amendment backer."" I'm an activist who has marched in Columbia, spoken of the importance of the the natural right to keep and bear arms, and taught people about the various laws infringing on your rights. I am 100% pro-gun. I want to get rid of all unconstitutional gun control laws -- which is every gun law! I am 100% pro-life. I'm not just anti-abortion, I'm an abolitionist. I want to end the #WarOnBabies! I want to see abortion eliminated in this country by aggressively defending the rights of the unborn through the 14th Amendment. On the subject of immigration we have to recognize that a wall is a temporary solution to a long term problem. It's a bandage when we need a tourniquet. We have to acknowledge how bad things are so we can treat the problem accordingly. What is helping to drive illegal immigration into the United States? Free stuff and drug trafficking. These are magnets for bad elements to cross the border. We have to be honest that some people want to exploit tax payers and the black market for drugs. Senator Graham has enabled this massive welfare system for that lures illegal immigrants to the country. If we demolish the welfare state, end the failed drug war, and have #FreeMarketImmigration, we can begin to turn this problem around!  Meanwhile, the bad elements -- the ones who only want to leech off the system or traffic drugs -- will self-deport! We will see the kind of assimilation that everyone agrees will benefit the country as a whole. I am #theAntiGraham. And I'm asking you to vote for me in the Republican primary, so you're not stuck with Graham in the general election! I'm David Weikle, candidate for US Senate.
