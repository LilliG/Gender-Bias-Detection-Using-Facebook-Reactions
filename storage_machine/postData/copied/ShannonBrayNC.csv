Shannon Bray for North Carolina,,2020-02-07 13:19:26,"You are being manipulated!!!! How does money really flow into politics? There is a fight to unseat Thom Tillis and I'm one of those looking to offer him to sabbatical. The Republican party is throwing its weight into the Democratic primary. Cal Cunningham is the projected winner in November 2020 but he hasn't cleared his primary yet; unlike myself who is going to November. In fear, the Republican party has decided to support Democratic Senator Erica Smith in hopes that she will beat Cal in the primary and believe she is an easy target in November. Basically, they are using Erica as a pawn. I'm not sure how she feels about it but the commercials playing seem to benefit her campaign. The average Senate race costs $10.5 million. Tillis has the money, Cal has the money, and now Erica is benefiting from the Republican party. Money in politics is a way to buy your vote.   I, myself, am not accepting any corporate finance and will undoubtedly get crushed in November.  I'm OK with that. I want to offer a 3rd party option but understand the country is divided into either being R or D and special interests are jumping in. The corporation behind Erica's new ads is a bank in VA. Why do they have an interest in NC? I'll leave that to you to figure out.

While this may seem oxymoronic in the minds of some, it makes sense in the mind of the typical non-libertarian. After all, Trump is a businessman.

Shannon Bray for North Carolina,,2019-10-01 19:09:44,"This post is to a specific person who asked a series of questions. I decided I needed to post it on the main page instead of buried in the weeds. What is your plan to help the farmers? The American farmer is vital to our economy. We should definitely continue to purse trade policy that works for the American farmer by standing up to China by working with our allies to negotiate from our strongest stance possible. I think there is merit to the discussion of expanding the microloan program for new farmers. It will also be beneficial to increase funding to the Department of Agriculture’s farm ownership and operating loans. Some of our farmers in NC are being pushed silent by large corporations. We should work with the small and even mid-size farms to develop more of a regional food system so that our food is always produced “locally”. We should improve our agricultural research areas. Small and mid-size farms also fall victim to antitrust laws so we should strengthen the enforcement of those laws. I also want to support the growth of medical marijuana in our state. The environment is perfect and many farmers have already switched over to growing hemp. Medical marijuana can be a cash crop for NC and it offers benefits against big pharma which will also help with medical costs. Does everyone get a 401(k) plan? A 401(k) is the most common type of retirement plan private-sector employers offer. However, many employers don't offer a 401(k), or any type of retirement plan at all. If you are in this group, can you still take advantage of the many benefits of a 401(k)? The quick answer is NO. What about the elderly? When it comes to the elderly, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed. In fact, these issues exist for a wider demographic than just the elderly. Some of the issues include the rising cost of prescription drugs. We need to get a handle on big pharma and control the costs of medications. The lack of insurance or savings to pay for the costs of nursing homes and assisted living are increasing but the elderly are on static payments. Most of the retired generation that I have interacted with desire to live better lives, not just longer lives. There are a number of shortages of geriatricians, nurses, and direct care workers to help them. I don’t yet have a plan to address that but it is on my radar. People in the advanced ages also suffer from isolation and loneliness. Seems like an easy fix but every situation is different. This also doesn’t help them navigate the complex programs and services that are actually paid for so these services get paid by us as tax payers but never actually help those in need. So to answer the direct question proposed to me, yes, I am trying to think about everyone including the elderly, veterans, first responders, and other groups who struggle. We have people in prison who are suffering from mental illness. In fact, I can go on a mental illness tangent of my own but you haven’t asked that question so I will keep the focus on your questions. Immigration? She stated,  “NC doesn’t like your stance on immigration!” The quotation ""all men are created equal"" is part of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which Thomas Jefferson penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution. The fact that the term ""illegal immigrants"" does not appear in the document doesn't mean that the U.S. Constitution's rights and freedoms do not apply to them. Often described as a ""living document,"" the Constitution has repeatedly been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal appeals courts, and Congress in order to address the ever-changing needs and demands of the people. While many argue that ""We the People of the United States,"" refers only to legal citizens, the Supreme Court has consistently disagreed. Feel free to review the following information: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have Now, don’t let the previous paragraphs get you all pissed off. I’m not proposing to open our borders and put everyone on a social warfare program. After all, we pay for the welfare programs with our tax dollars. As a Libertarian, my goal is to keep taxes as low as possible and find places where we are overspending. I do feel that people who are applying for citizenship should have a plan to take care of themselves but once they start working (with a visa), they are essentially paying taxes. Did you know that it is actually legal for illegal immigrants to vote locally in school board and other type of elections? It falls back to taxation without representation. In a previous post, I mentioned that I would support a program that would allow someone from another country to come here, ensure they understand our language and laws, and join either public service or the military. After an honorable discharge, citizenship should be granted to that person and their immediate family (spouse and legal children). We know it would be impossible for someone to not know the language and join the military so they would be disqualified. The military also has its own disqualifications. It’s up to the DoD on who they will accept. If someone has a plan to join the military in exchange for citizenship, I would be open to offering schooling that would help them acclimate to both the military and American culture. You asked a very specific question on if illegals would be able to get welfare while becoming citizens. The answer is NO but if they are legally working, then they are a taxpayer, therefore, support should be afforded.  Is this an all inclusive plan? Nope! It’s not even close. But I can’t go to Washington and do anything myself. The job would be to work with members on both sides to get stuff done. Everyone says that …. But they aren’t Libertarian. I am, by definition, outside both of their parties. This allows me to do what is best for the constituents in North Carolina without having to bow to either the Republicans or Democrats. It is my job to call BS when the sides aren’t playing together. As you have stated, NC doesn’t like my plans. That’s OK. I am happy to continue my service to this country working in cybersecurity, but should people feel the need to put a cybersecurity expert in to help patch the cyber issues in our country, then I’m ready for the job. I don’t want to fight over issues that have no resolution in sight. I want to focus on things I can win to help the country.  Not one person I have talked to has said cybersecurity is only a republican or democrat issue.  To add, I am 100% self-funded. I will not accept money from corporations or make any deals with financial ties. To prove it, I want to run a race that uses the least money ever in a campaign. I’ve given myself a budget of $7000. I will not be littering your streets with signs. I will not buy commercials. I will, however, start to do what I can to dominate the internet in ways that will help get my message out without spending a bunch of money. Once I do win, unless it takes 20 years and I’m retired with nothing to do, I plan to do one term, figure out the job and then invest in technology that will enable the constituents the ability to communicate effectively with their government. This includes those Senators like Thom Tillis that refuse to answer our questions. In a day where you can vote for your favorite idle on TV, why do you have to stand in line for hours to cast your vote for President. You shouldn’t! Are these simple tasks, no. But who else on the ballot ticket is looking to help you communicate with your representatives? By the way, I don’t consider anyone in Washington our leaders. They work for us. We are the boss. The President, Senate, Congress, and state government officials need to know that they represent us; not lead us.",6,4,,,2,,,7,504497343466406,/story.php?story_fbid=504497343466406&id=373845659864909

Shannon Bray for North Carolina,,2019-12-18 08:08:37,"Last night, I was asked what my stance is on corporate taxes. The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.  Most countries in the world recognize that corporations of any size (including the small mom and pop stores) produce large numbers of jobs which helps our economy. As a community, we want our businesses to grow and bring additional jobs to our area. We are no different here in North Carolina. The best corporate tax policy should be one that seeks to create wealth for all and a growth in our economy. From a governmental income point of view, that grows the tax base and increases tax income. A low tax rate on cash flow would be more desirable, offer fairness, and eliminates the majority of accounting manipulations that create additional unfairness.

Shannon Bray for North Carolina,,2019-10-01 19:09:44,"This post is to a specific person who asked a series of questions. I decided I needed to post it on the main page instead of buried in the weeds. What is your plan to help the farmers? The American farmer is vital to our economy. We should definitely continue to purse trade policy that works for the American farmer by standing up to China by working with our allies to negotiate from our strongest stance possible. I think there is merit to the discussion of expanding the microloan program for new farmers. It will also be beneficial to increase funding to the Department of Agriculture’s farm ownership and operating loans. Some of our farmers in NC are being pushed silent by large corporations. We should work with the small and even mid-size farms to develop more of a regional food system so that our food is always produced “locally”. We should improve our agricultural research areas. Small and mid-size farms also fall victim to antitrust laws so we should strengthen the enforcement of those laws. I also want to support the growth of medical marijuana in our state. The environment is perfect and many farmers have already switched over to growing hemp. Medical marijuana can be a cash crop for NC and it offers benefits against big pharma which will also help with medical costs. Does everyone get a 401(k) plan? A 401(k) is the most common type of retirement plan private-sector employers offer. However, many employers don't offer a 401(k), or any type of retirement plan at all. If you are in this group, can you still take advantage of the many benefits of a 401(k)? The quick answer is NO. What about the elderly? When it comes to the elderly, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed. In fact, these issues exist for a wider demographic than just the elderly. Some of the issues include the rising cost of prescription drugs. We need to get a handle on big pharma and control the costs of medications. The lack of insurance or savings to pay for the costs of nursing homes and assisted living are increasing but the elderly are on static payments. Most of the retired generation that I have interacted with desire to live better lives, not just longer lives. There are a number of shortages of geriatricians, nurses, and direct care workers to help them. I don’t yet have a plan to address that but it is on my radar. People in the advanced ages also suffer from isolation and loneliness. Seems like an easy fix but every situation is different. This also doesn’t help them navigate the complex programs and services that are actually paid for so these services get paid by us as tax payers but never actually help those in need. So to answer the direct question proposed to me, yes, I am trying to think about everyone including the elderly, veterans, first responders, and other groups who struggle. We have people in prison who are suffering from mental illness. In fact, I can go on a mental illness tangent of my own but you haven’t asked that question so I will keep the focus on your questions. Immigration? She stated,  “NC doesn’t like your stance on immigration!” The quotation ""all men are created equal"" is part of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which Thomas Jefferson penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution. The fact that the term ""illegal immigrants"" does not appear in the document doesn't mean that the U.S. Constitution's rights and freedoms do not apply to them. Often described as a ""living document,"" the Constitution has repeatedly been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal appeals courts, and Congress in order to address the ever-changing needs and demands of the people. While many argue that ""We the People of the United States,"" refers only to legal citizens, the Supreme Court has consistently disagreed. Feel free to review the following information: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have Now, don’t let the previous paragraphs get you all pissed off. I’m not proposing to open our borders and put everyone on a social warfare program. After all, we pay for the welfare programs with our tax dollars. As a Libertarian, my goal is to keep taxes as low as possible and find places where we are overspending. I do feel that people who are applying for citizenship should have a plan to take care of themselves but once they start working (with a visa), they are essentially paying taxes. Did you know that it is actually legal for illegal immigrants to vote locally in school board and other type of elections? It falls back to taxation without representation. In a previous post, I mentioned that I would support a program that would allow someone from another country to come here, ensure they understand our language and laws, and join either public service or the military. After an honorable discharge, citizenship should be granted to that person and their immediate family (spouse and legal children). We know it would be impossible for someone to not know the language and join the military so they would be disqualified. The military also has its own disqualifications. It’s up to the DoD on who they will accept. If someone has a plan to join the military in exchange for citizenship, I would be open to offering schooling that would help them acclimate to both the military and American culture. You asked a very specific question on if illegals would be able to get welfare while becoming citizens. The answer is NO but if they are legally working, then they are a taxpayer, therefore, support should be afforded.  Is this an all inclusive plan? Nope! It’s not even close. But I can’t go to Washington and do anything myself. The job would be to work with members on both sides to get stuff done. Everyone says that …. But they aren’t Libertarian. I am, by definition, outside both of their parties. This allows me to do what is best for the constituents in North Carolina without having to bow to either the Republicans or Democrats. It is my job to call BS when the sides aren’t playing together. As you have stated, NC doesn’t like my plans. That’s OK. I am happy to continue my service to this country working in cybersecurity, but should people feel the need to put a cybersecurity expert in to help patch the cyber issues in our country, then I’m ready for the job. I don’t want to fight over issues that have no resolution in sight. I want to focus on things I can win to help the country.  Not one person I have talked to has said cybersecurity is only a republican or democrat issue.  To add, I am 100% self-funded. I will not accept money from corporations or make any deals with financial ties. To prove it, I want to run a race that uses the least money ever in a campaign. I’ve given myself a budget of $7000. I will not be littering your streets with signs. I will not buy commercials. I will, however, start to do what I can to dominate the internet in ways that will help get my message out without spending a bunch of money. Once I do win, unless it takes 20 years and I’m retired with nothing to do, I plan to do one term, figure out the job and then invest in technology that will enable the constituents the ability to communicate effectively with their government. This includes those Senators like Thom Tillis that refuse to answer our questions. In a day where you can vote for your favorite idle on TV, why do you have to stand in line for hours to cast your vote for President. You shouldn’t! Are these simple tasks, no. But who else on the ballot ticket is looking to help you communicate with your representatives? By the way, I don’t consider anyone in Washington our leaders. They work for us. We are the boss. The President, Senate, Congress, and state government officials need to know that they represent us; not lead us.",6,4,,,2,,,7,504497343466406,/story.php?story_fbid=504497343466406&id=373845659864909
