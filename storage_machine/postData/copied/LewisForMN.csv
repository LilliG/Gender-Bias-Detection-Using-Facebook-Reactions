National Geographic's unmistakeable headline, without hesitation, ""Scientific consensus is overwhelming: The planet is getting warmer, and humans are behind it"" is a good example. There not only is no debate--but we won't allow one.  In fact, calling skeptics 'climate deniers' is exactly how the left's (dangerous) preoccupation with political censorship got its start.  But, as most people used to realize, science is often wrong. Contrary to the media hype, recent 'data' are in and the last decade and a half show a notable pause in warming with the last few years showing demonstrable cooling and droughts evaporating. We know there were times when CO2 levels were far higher than today and without computer model adjustments, raw temperature readings from satellite as well as ground base sensors show no catastrophic change one way or another.  According to a recent peer reviewed study, the three main surface temp datasets managed by NASA, NOAA and the UK's Met Office have used adjustments actually larger than recent trends in global warming. A ocean warming study had to be 'walked-back' after flaws were quickly found in its methodology used in part to conclude the 'ocean is warming...independent of direct ocean temperature measurements.'  So depending on which you adjust... Even if the US went carbonless (which seems to be #MN02  @AngieCraigMN wish as she is co-sponsoring a massive energy tax on electricity, gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil in a district home to a major refinery), IPCC figures show it would make no major difference on global temps. There is simply much we don't know--and that's the point. But if the world according to AOC is going to end in 12 years without drastic action, why no crash course in carbon-free nuclear power? Or is all the fantastic climate conformity just the most convenient answer in search of a why we need a $93 trillion dollar Green New Deal question?
