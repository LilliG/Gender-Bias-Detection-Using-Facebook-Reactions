Michelle Ferrigno Warren For United States Senate,,2019-10-30 15:10:47,"On one of my several trips to the Western Slope, I met Jasmin Ramirez who is running for the Roaring Fork School Board (RFSD), where 55% of the student body is Latino. Jasmin is an educator, active community member, parent of a Roaring Fork School District (RFSD) student, and a Latina. When I heard her share her heart for education and her community at an event we both attended, I knew I wanted to get to know her a little better. As I listened to her over coffee at the local Glenwood Springs Village Inn, I began to grow excited about Jasmin‚Äôs candidacy and the potential opportunities for the RFSD if she were elected. Jasmin Ramirez is a time-tested community leader who will bring a fresh perspective and voice to a rapidly changing district. It‚Äôs important to understand that voting for someone who can be a bridge to RFSD‚Äôs growing Latino school community is good for everyone. Bridge builders like Jasmin Ramirez bring communities together. It‚Äôs time to ensure that diverse leadership has a seat at the table, builds into and strengthens necessary racial bridges and helps everyone strive towards our shared American aspiration to be ‚Äúindivisible, with liberty and justice for all.‚Äù Jasmin‚Äôs life experience and smart ideas for the RFSD make it easy to see she is a well-qualified leader, which is why I am proud to endorse her as a candidate for District D.

As we are early in this election, we need to focus on engaging voters and re-building their trust.  We must remove the cancer of personal attacks and name calling from our public discourse.  These forums provide that very space.  If candidates can only get ahead through political bickering then they must not believe that people will be inspired by their message and leadership.  As the election progresses, we will be able to point out real policy differences and records but let's not devolve into calling each other out.

Michelle Ferrigno Warren For United States Senate,,2019-10-30 15:10:47,"On one of my several trips to the Western Slope, I met Jasmin Ramirez who is running for the Roaring Fork School Board (RFSD), where 55% of the student body is Latino. Jasmin is an educator, active community member, parent of a Roaring Fork School District (RFSD) student, and a Latina. When I heard her share her heart for education and her community at an event we both attended, I knew I wanted to get to know her a little better. As I listened to her over coffee at the local Glenwood Springs Village Inn, I began to grow excited about Jasmin‚Äôs candidacy and the potential opportunities for the RFSD if she were elected. Jasmin Ramirez is a time-tested community leader who will bring a fresh perspective and voice to a rapidly changing district. It‚Äôs important to understand that voting for someone who can be a bridge to RFSD‚Äôs growing Latino school community is good for everyone. Bridge builders like Jasmin Ramirez bring communities together. It‚Äôs time to ensure that diverse leadership has a seat at the table, builds into and strengthens necessary racial bridges and helps everyone strive towards our shared American aspiration to be ‚Äúindivisible, with liberty and justice for all.‚Äù Jasmin‚Äôs life experience and smart ideas for the RFSD make it easy to see she is a well-qualified leader, which is why I am proud to endorse her as a candidate for District D.

As we are early in this election, we need to focus on engaging voters and re-building their trust.  We must remove the cancer of personal attacks and name calling from our public discourse.  These forums provide that very space.  If candidates can only get ahead through political bickering then they must not believe that people will be inspired by their message and leadership.  As the election progresses, we will be able to point out real policy differences and records but let's not devolve into calling each other out.

Don‚Äôt be greedy. If you want to learn a little more about someone‚Äôs specific culture I was told to ask, ‚ÄúWhat nation do you represent?‚Äù When I introduced myself to One Nation Walking Together‚Äôs director and shared how I‚Äôd like to take time to schedule a listening gathering, tears welled in her eyes and she said, ‚Äúyou are going to make me cry. Thank you.‚Äù  I felt deeply grieved that it was so unfamiliar a thing to be asked that she would cry.  Democracy is supposed to be for everyone. People should be and feel welcomed. Politics should not be a club for the rich & powerful. We need to make people our highest priority.  #peopleoverpolitics",135,96,,39,,,,4,113712676646079,/story.php?story_fbid=113712676646079&id=106982643985749
