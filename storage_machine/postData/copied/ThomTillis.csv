Trump on initiatives to help North Carolinians and Keep America Great.  Resolution #1 - Continue to implement pro-growth economic policies that have led to record-low unemployment, unprecedented opportunities for women & minorities, and pay increases for lower wage earners that are outpacing those of higher wage earners. Resolution #2 - Continue to confirm more conservative judges who follow the Constitution instead of legislating from the bench. We have already confirmed 187 of President Trump’s judicial nominees, including Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, but we need to keep working.  Resolution #3 - Nearly 500 undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals, were released in NC during the last year due to radical sanctuary policies. It’s more important now than ever before that we pass my bills which curb sanctuary cities and hold them accountable.  Resolution #4 - Continue to stand up for President Trump’s rights and allow the American people to see how unfairly he was treated by Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler, so we can put impeachment behind us and move on to the issues that matter for North Carolinians.  Resolution #5 - Continue to back the aggressive trade approach President Trump has taken, which is bringing China to the table and got us a great USMCA deal that will create jobs and provide much needed assistance for our farmers.  Resolution #6 - Continue to support North Carolina military families like we did in the most recent appropriations package, which included an across-the-board pay raise of 3.1% for our troops, secured $2.2 billion for NC military bases, and increased access to health care and employment opportunities for veterans.  Resolution #7 - Continue to push for President Trump’s immigration reform bill, which provides $25 billion for the wall, ends chain migration, ends “catch and release,” and moves America to a merit-based immigration system.  Resolution #8 - Continue to work with President Trump to make sure we bring terrorists like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to justice and keep all Americans safe.  Resolution #9 - Continue to expand opportunities for career and technical training for North Carolina students so they are prepared to meet the needs of the modern workforce.  Resolution #10 - Continue to fight back against the radical, liberal agenda so that you can keep your employer-based health insurance, so that you won’t be crushed by trillions in new tax increases, and so that you can decide for yourself what car to drive and what foods to eat.
