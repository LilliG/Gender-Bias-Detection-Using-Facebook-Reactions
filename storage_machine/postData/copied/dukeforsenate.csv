"Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner",,2020-04-22 11:57:07,"Republican U.S. Senate Candidate Duke Buckner            ""Contract with South Carolina"" 2020 Whereas the South Carolina Republican Party was founded by Robert Smalls, a former slave from Beaufort, SC who breathed into our Grand Old Party the founding principles of Faith, Love and Courage. And for the SCGOP's commitment and application of these principles in the creation of public policy, I believe God has blessed the state of South Carolina. And for God's continued blessings and prosperity be bestowed upon the state of South Carolina and its people, I henceforth pledge to act and vote in a manner that is consistent to the long established fundamental principles of the Republican Party and not compromise our state's conservative values and beliefs for the sake of bi-partisanship or to be ""relevant."" Furthermore, I pledge to work to make into law either by sponsorship or co-sponsorship the following Pro Life, Pro Second Amendment, Pro Fiscal Responsibility Legislative agenda: I)  The Right to Life Act Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parent Hood defined too many children as “any more than the mother can look after and the father make a living for.”  She believed the most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.  In 2018, 10,732 abortions were performed in S.C. (Source: SCDHEC)  I believe that children are a blessing from God, not a burden; they have a right to life.  Thus to reduce the increasing number of abortions, I support that they be prohibited with no exceptions.  II)  The Second Amendment Protection Act I believe we would be British subjects today if the colonists not had muskets when British soldiers came to squelch the rebellion.  Therefore, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  Thus, I support the protection of our 2nd Amendment and oppose Red Flag Laws and any additional gun control legislation that infringes upon that right.      III)    2030 Debt Free Act Currently, the United States is estimated to be 19 trillion in debt.  I believe the borrower is servant to the lender.  Thus, in the spirit of President Andrew Jackson, I believe we can pay off our national debt within 10 years.  To achieve this goal, I support 1) a balanced budget amendment  2) reduced government spending  3) eliminating all unnecessary foreign aid  4) end deficit spending  5) a line-item veto  6) stricter enforcement of businesses who are under reporting wages  7) auctioning off unneeded U.S. Assets  8) designate that all budget surpluses, if any, each year go towards paying off the national debt.  IV) The Fatherhood Preservation Act Fathers play an important role in the development of their children.  Research has shown that fathers who are positively involved in the life of their children help promote emotional stability and cognitive development.  Therefore, I support joint custody and standard visitation rights be awarded to fathers who obey the law and are Court ordered to pay child support.   V)  The Natural Food Consumption Act The Republican Party has a history of concern for the Earth and the impact the environment has on the health of our citizens.  President Richard Nixon (R) founded the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Subsequently, Congress passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.  I believe in the old adage that ""You are what you Eat.” Therefore, I support the promotion, protection and expansion of organic farming and organic livestock farming.  To these ends and in exchange for your vote in the Republican Primary on Tuesday June 9, 2020 and the general election on Tuesday November 3, 2020, I pledge my support by affixing my signature hereto: Duke Buckner Candidate for U.S. Senate ""Time for the Righteous to Govern""   Please Forward this Contract to your friends and Family",34,30,1,3,,,,,238198157529396,/story.php?story_fbid=238198157529396&id=109576973724849

"Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner",,2020-04-03 20:58:21,"This is one of my most cherished photos that I want to share with everyone because there is a lie going around that I am some how a plant from the Democratic party and not a Republican. Pictured here is me and former South Carolina Republican Governor, Governor David Beasley in the late 90’s. When I was in the newspaper business, he came to Walterboro, South Carolina to help dedicate the Tuskegee Airmen Monument at the Walterboro Army Airfield. This is the airfield where the Tuskegee Airmen trained before going off to fly combat missions in World War II. It was a grand occasion and many of the former Tuskegee Airmen were in attendance at the event! I followed closely Governor David Beasley's political career after meeting him that day. He inspired me and I supported him. I use to ride around with a Beasley sticker on the back of my car! And my Dad would say, ""Boy take that sticker off the back of that car!"" My Dad was a staunch Democrat and I was taught to be one as well until I met Governor Beasley that day and began to think differently. It was Governor David Beasley that had the courage to stand up against the video poker industry in South Carolina and say in a state of the state address that ""We are going to end video poker in South Carolina!"" I couldn't afford cable t.v. back then, and all I could catch was ETV. So when I heard him say that, I totally agreed with him. Video poker machines were like a cancer spreading across the state. People were putting their hard earned money into them and mothers were leaving their children unattended in their cars in order to play them. They were bad for South Carolina! The last thing Governor Beasley said that ended his political career was when he said, the Lord told him to take the Confederate Flag down from on top of the State House dome! When he said that, it was over for him. I thought to myself, here was a White male, Republican, who I was taught were suppose to be all racists was now saying, ""God told me at 3:00 am to take the Confederate Flag down!"" I knew then that all the negative things I heard growing up about the Republican Party did not apply to Governor David Beasley. The next election Jim Hodges, Democrat, became Governor of S.C. However, Governor Beasley let me know right then that Republicans stood for principle; Governor Beasley stood for what was right even though it cost him his political career. I want to personally thank Governor David Beasley for what he did to make South Carolina a better place for all people and for setting an example for what the Republican Party Stands for. It is my sincere hope that I will do the same as your next U.S. Senator. Thanks Governor Beasley! May God continue to Bless you and your family and that you have a full recovery from the corona virus. Duke",64,56,,8,,,,,225159545499924,/story.php?story_fbid=225159545499924&id=109576973724849

I am asking for your vote and support and need your help.

"Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner",,2020-01-31 17:31:03,"These are the REASONS WHY I am against calling new witnesses and would be voting NO! First, I do not believe the Articles of Impeachment presented to the Senate by House Democrats came with “Clean Hands.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held the Articles for almost a month after pushing that the impeachment hearings needed to be completed as soon as possible. Second, against established precedent, House Democrats conducted the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors instead of in public. Last, if any testimony that should have been held behind closed doors would have been that of the Whistle Blower. However, to my understanding He or She never testified during the House inquiry when it was their complaint that started the whole impeachment process! I see the Senate trial as being synonymous to a Court of Equity. Removal of the President from Office as being similar to an Injunction which is an equitable remedy that stops or prohibits someone from doing something. In this case, it would be prohibiting President Trump from remaining in office. To seek an equitable remedy, you must have “clean hands.” If you don’t have clean hands then your complaint is dismissed which would also include the need to call further witnesses.",29,28,,1,,,,,180943479921531,/story.php?story_fbid=180943479921531&id=109576973724849

I am seeking the Republican Party's nomination.  The seat that is currently held by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The Republican primary is Tuesday, June 9, 2020.   I invite you all to follow me on this journey as there will be many trials and tribulations faced in the upcoming months leading to the election on June 9th, 2020. With YOUR support I believe mountains can be moved and CHANGE can finally be put in motion.       The one thing I see that government officials is lacking is a TRUE listening ear to the people. If there is one thing that I can promise during this campaign, and after we win, is that you will have both of my ears, and the ears of the members of my team; constantly listening.  Follow this Facebook page as it will provide information on up coming events being planned for the campaign but also it will be used as on open source of communication thru out the community. Here, everyone has a voice, and all opinions are valued.  There is a lot of work to be done, but if we have all hands on board for a brighter future, then that day is not too far ahead!

,,2019-08-15 11:46:43,"Yesterday, I had the opportunity to tour 'DC Machine' located in Summerville, which is one of the largest gun barrel manufacturers in the nation. I had great conversations with Mark Petty, who is the Quality Engineer, Product Specialist and Sales Manager of the plant. We talked about our 2nd Amendment and the right to bear arms. Ultimately, I believe that gun violence in America is a matter of the heart of man and that is where the issue will have to be addressed for there to be any long term solution to the problem.  Unlike Senator Graham who supports red flag laws, I am not in favor of implementing any proposed infringement upon a Constitutional right without exploring the least restrictive means first.

"Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner",,2019-08-16 09:28:05,"As a former Colleton County middle and high school English teacher, I have a simple formula to improve the quality of education and academic success for all public school students in South Carolina. First, we must have in every class room in South Carolina teachers who really want to teach and are excellent at what they do. Unfortunately, we have some bad teachers in our school system. We also have teachers who no longer have the fire in their belly to teach anymore. Thus, they lack the enthusiasm and creativity needed to be effective in the classroom. We must find a way to help those teachers transition out of the public school system into comparable jobs in either the public or private sector where their skills can be best utilized.

"Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner",,2019-08-16 09:28:05,"As a former Colleton County middle and high school English teacher, I have a simple formula to improve the quality of education and academic success for all public school students in South Carolina. First, we must have in every class room in South Carolina teachers who really want to teach and are excellent at what they do. Unfortunately, we have some bad teachers in our school system. We also have teachers who no longer have the fire in their belly to teach anymore. Thus, they lack the enthusiasm and creativity needed to be effective in the classroom. We must find a way to help those teachers transition out of the public school system into comparable jobs in either the public or private sector where their skills can be best utilized.

"Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner",,2019-08-07 12:43:35,"Dear friends and family: As some of you might know, but most just finding out, I have officially announced my candidacy for U.S. Senate. I am seeking the Republican Party's nomination.  The seat that is currently held by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The Republican primary is Tuesday, June 9, 2020.   I invite you all to follow me on this journey as there will be many trials and tribulations faced in the upcoming months leading to the election on June 9th, 2020. With YOUR support I believe mountains can be moved and CHANGE can finally be put in motion.       The one thing I see that government officials is lacking is a TRUE listening ear to the people. If there is one thing that I can promise during this campaign, and after we win, is that you will have both of my ears, and the ears of the members of my team; constantly listening.  Follow this Facebook page as it will provide information on up coming events being planned for the campaign but also it will be used as on open source of communication thru out the community. Here, everyone has a voice, and all opinions are valued.  There is a lot of work to be done, but if we have all hands on board for a brighter future, then that day is not too far ahead! Sincerely, Dwayne ""Duke"" Buckner “It Is Time For The Righteous To Govern!”",20,15,,5,,,,,110941440255069,/story.php?story_fbid=110941440255069&id=109576973724849
