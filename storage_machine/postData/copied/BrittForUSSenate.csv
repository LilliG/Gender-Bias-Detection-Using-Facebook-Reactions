Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2020-04-28 18:43:28,"As a workforce professional, I find several of the comments by public officials, as quoted in this article, disturbing, particularly those of Don Morris, Executive Director of Workforce Development for the State of Oklahoma, and Teresa Keller, Deputy Director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. Do we need to start preparing to reopen businesses in Oklahoma? Yes, we do.  Will all the jobs come back right away? Certainly not. It will take months, possibly a year, to lower unemployment rates to pre-quarantine levels.  Businesses who terminated their employees during this crisis will likely have to hire many new employees, as opposed to rehiring those let go. Those of us who post jobs and hire people for a living understand all too well that this process can take days or weeks, or even months given the experience level or the number of positions to fill.  Return to work challenges are not a matter of “carrot” or “stick” Mr. Mariska. It’s is a matter of mass corporate culture disenfranchisement, especially when the positions to which you are referring are minimum wage roles. Those who make the least should not have the assistance Congress allotted them petitioned away by non-elected state officials or the governor’s acquaintances.  Employees who have been furloughed, the regulations and guidelines operate a little differently. Yes, if a business opens up and a furloughed employee refuses scheduled hours, then that will negatively impact their unemployment eligibility for that time, or for that portion of income not earned depending on your employment classification, it can also jeopardize your employment status.  Regardless, the idea that the Governor’s Council for Workforce and Economic Development is contemplating requesting the federal government to reduce the unemployment stimulus benefits while 224,000+ Oklahomans are out of work is appalling.  The people of this state did not ask for a pandemic. They did not ask to have their livelihoods put in jeopardy. They did not ask to have their wages reduced or to lose their jobs. And they certainly aren’t asking to be faced with choosing between a paycheck and their health while we are still uncertain as to how the virus will spread in the coming weeks once Oklahoma reopens. What Oklahomans have asked for is rent and eviction protections, and free coronavirus testing statewide. The latter has garnered some discussion, while rent and housing protection had failed to gain momentum. Ms. Keller, ma’am, the funding provided by Congress lasts until July 31st. I encourage you not to send in the 30-day notification requesting an end to the additional $600.00 stimulus assistance. We don’t yet know how Oklahoma’s employment situation will change in the next three months. Be patient. The ramifications of reducing benefits too early could be disastrous. There is still time to study projections and act in the best interest of the public. My counsel to everyone on the governor’s commission, all of who do not live on minimum wage or even lower wages – stop listening to the one or two people who tell you what you want to hear and start looking to the tens of thousands of Oklahomans whose lives may be turned upside down because you think they’re making too much money with an additional $600 per week in the middle of a pandemic. Otherwise, the only “disincentive effect” will be which way the polls swing in the next election, which is fine by me, but not at the expense of unemployed Oklahomans.

Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2019-08-12 15:04:04,"While the Trump Administration has focused it's attention on North Korean nuclear ambitions, Russia has been developing smaller, nuclear-powered, long-range strike weapons which have been designed for one purpose - a nuclear strike on the United States.  Though the weapon, the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, was thought to be a concept, but reports from overseas indicate the explosion Thursday at a Russian arms depot in the White Sea off Nyonoksa caused a reported nearby radiation spike in Severodvinsk. State-controlled nuclear energy company Rosatom later said the explosion occurred during a test of ""a nuclear isotope power source"" for a rocket, according to the BBC. In March 2018 during Putin's 14th state of the nation address, Putin unveiled the prototype rocket concept, ""a low-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile...with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defense and air defense."" A move that may have kicked off a new era in nuclear weaponry, as earlier this month, the United States formally withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). This is a very, very serious issue, which threatens to begin a new nuclear arms race. President Trump, and our European allies, must address Vladimir Putin sternly on the issue of nuclear proliferation. This type of weapon has no place in the future any of us hope to live in. Whether it be a physical, electronic or social threat, Congress must do every single thing they can to limit the amount of influence Russia may be trying to exert on the United States.",21,13,,2,5,1,,,489788028256189,/story.php?story_fbid=489788028256189&id=480085069226485

Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2019-08-05 20:10:17,"My heart is heavy, and the feelings make words seem so feckless. The acts of violence and the loss of life this past week tear at my soul.  Like many of you, I feel a sense of anger and helplessness at the continued pervasiveness of these shootings, these domestic attacks on American soil. And while we speculate as to the cause or the reason how such events could take place, there are commonalities that join all of these senseless acts together which we must recognize, and those are anger, hatred and anguish, which can result in the drive to murder. It’s the intent which perplexes us. The will to will to commit terror. The evil. For those of us left behind to deal with the aftermath finding a solution to avert such problems is a daunting challenge. Was it the gun? Was it something that someone said or didn’t say? Was it the loss of hope in feeling loved? Was it glory seeking? No one really knows for sure. All we know is that a horrific thing happened and our communities grieve, our people are angry and with fear, our children are worried about their safety and the future. This must not be normalized.  In America, it would seem, the ease of access to firearms for those who have no business owning them and no training on how to handle them creates a constitutional crisis. What’s the solution? Is it stronger background checks? Should a waiting period be enacted? How do we address concerns of mental illness? These are all valid questions which must be explored and addressed.  Other challenges come up in this process of trying to create a safer society. For instance, the mass shooting at Columbine in Littleton, Colorado was carried out by young men who purchased weapons through another person, at Sandy Hook the gunman’s mother had bought the gun, in the Parkland assault, the gunman legally purchased the gun despite several red flags that went unaddressed by law enforcement. These are the well known cases, but murder by firearm happens everyday in communities all around us.  The truth of the matter is, there is no justification that could ever make these murderous acts makes sense. They are acts of domestic terrorism typically borne out of racism, bigotry and/or the devaluation of others.  We could pass legislation that removes the ability of an individual to possess a firearm legally, but loopholes for obtaining firearms still exist; gun shows, private sales, theft, and an emerging 3D printing technology. Plus there’s the 2nd Amendment which creates formidable obstacles to enacting change.  We all know America will never give up the gun. We are a nation that began with the shot heard round the world, as described in Ralph Waldo Emerson‘s poem “Concord Hymn”, but if we do not find a way to overcome this challenge, we risk becoming a nation that gives up part of our freedoms because of the gun. The freedom to shop, the freedom to enjoy a day at the park with our kids, the freedom to assemble without fear of massacre.  After Parkland, I drafted a proposal for a national background check system with a magnetic strip embedded in photo ID that could be used for every purchase, including the purchase of ammunition. This system would cross reference local and national systems for red flags and notify merchants of their liability if they sell to a flagged individual. The most important part is the background on ammunition, as most “dirty” transactions happen in the private arena and do not include the bullets. Think about it. Private sellers don’t sell the bullets and guns to a stranger. The new owner must buy them elsewhere, lest the seller wind up shot. It’s an idea at least. More than most politicians will put forth.  I still believe very much that this proposal would be effective in reducing gun violence. It wouldn’t eradicate gun violence but it’s a huge step in the right direction. It’s certainly an actionable idea.  Still, it doesn’t remove the sting of the tragedies that have taken place, nor does it bring back those we’ve lost. But we must try to work to prevent this from continuing to happen. We must keep working. We can’t accept this as the new norm.",37,30,1,6,,,,,486299568605035,/story.php?story_fbid=486299568605035&id=480085069226485

Let me begin this initial post by saying, “This is not the campaign I ran in 2018”. If anything, my 2018 campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives was an opportunity to grow personally and politically in order to bring a much more concentrated fight to securing a better future for all Oklahomans. Make no mistake, this campaign is about you, my Oklahoma family whom I love very much. Last year you shared your lives with me. You shared your needs and struggles. We spoke about what was working and how to improve on our successes. I was attentively listening, formulating ideas and building relationships so that I may serve you.  I believe Oklahomans are in desperate need of a change in representation. We need representation that puts Oklahomans first and not any individual from out of state, nor a singular political party, or industry.  Over the next few months, you and I will host a dialog about our nation, our future and what we intend to pass on to future generations. We will discuss the tough issues, what has worked, what hasn’t, and what is possible with a community-focused mindset. The only things I ask of you here on social media is to actively participate in constructive discussion, respect the opinions of others and invite others to join us. Let the good fight begin!

Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2019-08-14 22:40:11,"Since 9/11 the United States has spent over $6 Trillion dollars on war. At an additional cost of 5,462 troops killed in action, 52,887 wounded in action, and over 250,000 civilian non-combatants killed in the Middle East and Afghanistan.  Continued armed conflicts are not in best interest of the United States - not globally, not economically and not at great cost to service members and their families.  The time has come to use cooperative reason and intellect instead of bullets and bombs to achieve peace.  “Though force can protect in emergency, only justice, fairness, consideration and cooperation can finally lead men to the dawn of eternal peace.” ~ President Dwight D. Eisenhower #BringTheTroopsHome",56,45,,8,3,,,,490980714803587,/story.php?story_fbid=490980714803587&id=480085069226485

Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2019-08-12 15:04:04,"While the Trump Administration has focused it's attention on North Korean nuclear ambitions, Russia has been developing smaller, nuclear-powered, long-range strike weapons which have been designed for one purpose - a nuclear strike on the United States.  Though the weapon, the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, was thought to be a concept, but reports from overseas indicate the explosion Thursday at a Russian arms depot in the White Sea off Nyonoksa caused a reported nearby radiation spike in Severodvinsk. State-controlled nuclear energy company Rosatom later said the explosion occurred during a test of ""a nuclear isotope power source"" for a rocket, according to the BBC. In March 2018 during Putin's 14th state of the nation address, Putin unveiled the prototype rocket concept, ""a low-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile...with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defense and air defense."" A move that may have kicked off a new era in nuclear weaponry, as earlier this month, the United States formally withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). This is a very, very serious issue, which threatens to begin a new nuclear arms race. President Trump, and our European allies, must address Vladimir Putin sternly on the issue of nuclear proliferation. This type of weapon has no place in the future any of us hope to live in. Whether it be a physical, electronic or social threat, Congress must do every single thing they can to limit the amount of influence Russia may be trying to exert on the United States.",21,13,,2,5,1,,,489788028256189,/story.php?story_fbid=489788028256189&id=480085069226485

Please share this page, invite people to the conversation and donate if you can. Volunteer opportunities will be available soon, as will a full website with events and more. I'm very much looking forward to visiting folks around the state and discussing the issues with you.  It's past time to move on from Sen. Inhofe's disregard for who we've become and who we wish to be as a nation. I'm ready to lift up the often overlooked voice of Oklahomans in the U.S. Senate. This is the time to band together and work to create the change our state and our nation needs.  Thank you again for being here.

Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2019-08-05 20:10:17,"My heart is heavy, and the feelings make words seem so feckless. The acts of violence and the loss of life this past week tear at my soul.  Like many of you, I feel a sense of anger and helplessness at the continued pervasiveness of these shootings, these domestic attacks on American soil. And while we speculate as to the cause or the reason how such events could take place, there are commonalities that join all of these senseless acts together which we must recognize, and those are anger, hatred and anguish, which can result in the drive to murder. It’s the intent which perplexes us. The will to will to commit terror. The evil. For those of us left behind to deal with the aftermath finding a solution to avert such problems is a daunting challenge. Was it the gun? Was it something that someone said or didn’t say? Was it the loss of hope in feeling loved? Was it glory seeking? No one really knows for sure. All we know is that a horrific thing happened and our communities grieve, our people are angry and with fear, our children are worried about their safety and the future. This must not be normalized.  In America, it would seem, the ease of access to firearms for those who have no business owning them and no training on how to handle them creates a constitutional crisis. What’s the solution? Is it stronger background checks? Should a waiting period be enacted? How do we address concerns of mental illness? These are all valid questions which must be explored and addressed.  Other challenges come up in this process of trying to create a safer society. For instance, the mass shooting at Columbine in Littleton, Colorado was carried out by young men who purchased weapons through another person, at Sandy Hook the gunman’s mother had bought the gun, in the Parkland assault, the gunman legally purchased the gun despite several red flags that went unaddressed by law enforcement. These are the well known cases, but murder by firearm happens everyday in communities all around us.  The truth of the matter is, there is no justification that could ever make these murderous acts makes sense. They are acts of domestic terrorism typically borne out of racism, bigotry and/or the devaluation of others.  We could pass legislation that removes the ability of an individual to possess a firearm legally, but loopholes for obtaining firearms still exist; gun shows, private sales, theft, and an emerging 3D printing technology. Plus there’s the 2nd Amendment which creates formidable obstacles to enacting change.  We all know America will never give up the gun. We are a nation that began with the shot heard round the world, as described in Ralph Waldo Emerson‘s poem “Concord Hymn”, but if we do not find a way to overcome this challenge, we risk becoming a nation that gives up part of our freedoms because of the gun. The freedom to shop, the freedom to enjoy a day at the park with our kids, the freedom to assemble without fear of massacre.  After Parkland, I drafted a proposal for a national background check system with a magnetic strip embedded in photo ID that could be used for every purchase, including the purchase of ammunition. This system would cross reference local and national systems for red flags and notify merchants of their liability if they sell to a flagged individual. The most important part is the background on ammunition, as most “dirty” transactions happen in the private arena and do not include the bullets. Think about it. Private sellers don’t sell the bullets and guns to a stranger. The new owner must buy them elsewhere, lest the seller wind up shot. It’s an idea at least. More than most politicians will put forth.  I still believe very much that this proposal would be effective in reducing gun violence. It wouldn’t eradicate gun violence but it’s a huge step in the right direction. It’s certainly an actionable idea.  Still, it doesn’t remove the sting of the tragedies that have taken place, nor does it bring back those we’ve lost. But we must try to work to prevent this from continuing to happen. We must keep working. We can’t accept this as the new norm.",37,30,1,6,,,,,486299568605035,/story.php?story_fbid=486299568605035&id=480085069226485

Spent yesterday afternoon running around meeting with people, and all night working on policy and an initial website.  I realize November 2020 is a long way off and everything will come together. Please know my hopes and optimism are fully invested in bringing you much needed support.  This week, I’ll be working on creating walk cards and informational materials so you can become more familiar with my positions on the issues. I hope to begin printing and mailing that material to the counties soon, as well as posting it online.  At the end of June, Senator Inhofe reported having over $1.5 million dollars cash on hand. If you would, please make a donation to help fund our campaign’s beginning stages. It will take a community effort to reach across the state, and your support is vital to our success.

Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate,,2019-07-24 22:10:43,"Hello and thank you for visiting my Facebook page, Elysabeth Britt for U.S. Senate. Let me begin this initial post by saying, “This is not the campaign I ran in 2018”. If anything, my 2018 campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives was an opportunity to grow personally and politically in order to bring a much more concentrated fight to securing a better future for all Oklahomans. Make no mistake, this campaign is about you, my Oklahoma family whom I love very much. Last year you shared your lives with me. You shared your needs and struggles. We spoke about what was working and how to improve on our successes. I was attentively listening, formulating ideas and building relationships so that I may serve you.  I believe Oklahomans are in desperate need of a change in representation. We need representation that puts Oklahomans first and not any individual from out of state, nor a singular political party, or industry.  Over the next few months, you and I will host a dialog about our nation, our future and what we intend to pass on to future generations. We will discuss the tough issues, what has worked, what hasn’t, and what is possible with a community-focused mindset. The only things I ask of you here on social media is to actively participate in constructive discussion, respect the opinions of others and invite others to join us. Let the good fight begin!
