Sara Gideon,,2020-01-15 12:41:26,"For too long, politicians have been taking money from special interests and working for them in Washington instead of the people they represent.  That’s why I’m pledging to take bold action to end the influence of special interests in Washington – which starts with my Reform Agenda. 1. First and foremost, we must overturn the Supreme Court's decision on Citizens United in order to stop corporations and special interests from spending unlimited amounts of money in our elections. 2. We also have to crack down on secret spending by dark money groups. That’s why I support passing the DISCLOSE Act – which Senator Collins voted against – to require these groups to disclose their donors when they’re using funds to influence elections.  3. Congress routinely fails to pass budgets on time. If members of Congress can’t do their job, they shouldn’t get paid – period. That’s why my plan also includes passing “No Budget, No Pay” legislation. 4. Our elected officials should be accountable to the people they’re elected to represent, not big corporations. That’s why I’m not accepting any money from corporate PACs in my campaign, and I won’t as a U.S. Senator.  5. Lobbying is the most common profession pursued by Senators and Representatives after they leave office, which gives corporations and special interests even more influence. I’m proposing we put an end to the revolving door by banning former members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists. 6. Lawmakers and staff in Washington frequently skirt the rules to rub elbows with powerful lobbyists. No one should be evading ethics rules to attend lavish receptions held to sway elected officials – in the Senate, I’ll refuse any gifts or meals from lobbyists. 7. Lobbyists and special interests also pay for trips for members of Congress. In the Senate, I’ll refuse trips paid for by special interests. My Reform Agenda would be the biggest campaign finance and reform package adopted in Congress in over a decade — and I believe it’s what we need right now. I’m running to stand up to special interests once and for all.",28,22,,6,,,,1,2525894134404120,/story.php?story_fbid=2525894134404120&id=2330577043935831
