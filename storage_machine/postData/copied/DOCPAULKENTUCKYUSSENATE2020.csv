I was a sweeper, I swept the whole factory until I was permitted to be trained on machines and reading blue prints. I cleaned and worked on the machines so I would be able to operate them properly. I know factory work and what blue collar people do. The way I see it would be that this is an issue for the voter's of Kentucky to vote on. It should be a ballot issue and in my own opinion I feel if you work hard and do a good job you shouldn't have any worries.
