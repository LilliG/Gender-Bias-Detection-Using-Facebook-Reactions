"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-05-01 13:36:05,"5/1 COVID-19 update: (Happy May) Good News - ICU use stays steady for 12 days, even with almost 2,000 additional active cases in that time period. 4,553 tests is close to the 5,000 benchmark the Governor set. Bad News - Numbers continue marching upwards - no peak in sight. In following my mother-in-law's case it became clear we are missing a key number. As you know my mother-in-law tested positive for COVID-19 but is asymptomatic. How many of the active cases we have are asymptomatic? I reached out to the Minnesota Department of Health and Julie Bartkey replied they don't have that data.  That data would be very helpful. We know a percentage of active cases are asymptomatic we just don't know how large that percentage is. If it were 50%, our active case load drops from 3077 to 1538. Hopefully we can get that percentage in the days to come. I would still like to see us reopen more retail where social distancing can be maintained. Let's hope we see that earlier rather than later.

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-29 15:14:04,"4/29 COVID-19 Update: New York comparison. Good news - Testing increases. ICU use plateaus. Bad news - Numerical peak not reached. Coming from the East Coast I always found it interesting how we Minnesotans desire relevance in the national discussion. I've noticed we often compare ourselves to New York and New York City when wanting to be given the respect we deserve. Since New York is on the decline in COVID-cases (at least for now), what would it look like if Minnesota mirrors New York in the cases of COVID-19 and deaths.  Population: NY - 19.45 mil  MN - 5.64 mil Cases: NY - 295,106 (1.5% of pop)  MN - 4,181 (.07%) Hospitalized: NY - 64,275 (21.78% of cases)  MN - 912 (21.8%)  Recovered: NY - 51,630  (17.4% of cases)  MN 1912 (45.7%) Total ICU: NY - NA    MN 324 (35.5% of hosp. cases) Deaths: NY - 17,638 (5.97% of cases)  MN 301 (7.19% of cases) The most important question is are we going to be like New York or have a large group of Minnesotans already had the virus, showed no symptoms, or otherwise built up an immunity to the virus? We won't know for sure until the antibody tests are widely available. If we are to inevitably end up like New York it will look like this (at the same point after the peak is reached) : MN total cases - 84,600 (1.5% of pop) MN deaths - 5050 (5.97% of cases) Hospitalizations - 17,766 (21.78% of cases) ICU total - 6306 (35.5% of hosp. cases) Is it inevitable that we be compared to New York yet again or are we special in our own Minnesota way?

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-29 10:49:20,"I've been hearing this from my daughters who know people who are making more on unemployment than they did at their jobs. I didn't know it was around half of those laid off.  Reopening our economy will be challenging if half of our workers won't return because they make more on unemployment than they would if they went back to work.  Minnesota is near the top of the nation for unemployment benefits.  This is a classic example of how a well-meaning government program can cause harm to a society and not help. We need to focus on individuals as the answer and not government programs. We need to incentivize work and innovation, not idleness.

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-28 21:49:07,"As an Iron-Ranger, I support Rob Barrett for U.S. Senate because he understands that we need mining and industry back in the United States. He is pro-worker, pro-American Made and against the right-to-work laws that have needlessly lost the MNGOP so many races in the past. We need every vote, and outreach to non-traditional Republican voters is non-negotiable.     This brings me to another important point: creativity. Conservatives often seem to think that “conservative” means doing nothing new or original. The world is changing around us and we need new ways of thinking about and doing things. Rob is not from some stodgy think tank or the pundit class, he is from the arts, academic and entertainment world. His campaign videos on Facebook are fresh, funny and original. Not only that, these peppy videos show the MNGOP as it could be, a vibrant, smart, young party with dreams of a better future whose members represent every group in the state. On a related note I don’t think I need to tell you how effective a politician with television experience can be and Rob, through his reality cooking show has already bonded to non-traditional Republican voters.   Also, I want to mention that Rob has handled the COVID crisis with an even and caring hand, looking at both sides of the argument gracefully and thoughtfully and treating all respectfully. For these reasons I am happy to endorse him in his bid for U.S. Senate Jacob Giese VP Media St. Louis County GOP #WeAreMN",36,34,,2,,,,,640279463191623,/story.php?story_fbid=640279463191623&id=398986710654234

It seems like people are relaxing their vigilance and are not taking the virus as seriously as we were just a week ago. The Governor's dialing back of the Shelter at Home order is a good step. We will know more in 5 days. It's hard to imagine we can make a call on the Minnesota State Fair at this point. There is hope in the data. If you are sick enough to get tested, and we have tested 53,787 Minnesotans, you stand a 5.9% chance of being positive. Of those who test positive there is a death rate of 6.9%. These look ominous. but if you look at the death rate of those who are sick enough to get tested, (and you need to have significant symptoms) the death rate is only 0.4%.

Biggest testing day so far with 2,204 tests.  Bad news: 21 deaths. 21 people died alone and there are 21 grieving families. Say a prayer for them. It will be interesting to watch the Minnesota model versus the Georgia and Tennessee models as they start to reopen more businesses. We should know pretty quickly as the median time for a patient to show COVID-19 symptoms is 5 days (90% show symptoms in 7 days).  So as we mentioned in our reopening plan, the 5 day mark is key for reopening safely and responsibly. I continue to be encouraged by the bottom right graph. The vast amount of people who were likely to have COVID-19 (not random testing but very selective testing) and received tests have tested negative.

You can see the very steady growth of daily new cases on the lower right graph. Once this levels off and declines we will be in pretty good shape. Our death rate continues to be very low even though our perceived total case number is low due to lack of large scale testing.

On April 8th in the midst of extreme predictions of deaths of 22,000 - 60,000 Minnesotans, we put out 2 predictive graphs. One on what the growth curve would have to look like for the U of M model (the one being used by the Walz administration, 3rd pic below) and the other what it would look like if current trends being mapped buy us continued (2nd pic below).  While it's only been 2 weeks and the U of M model predicted a curve not a straight line, you can see our predictions are much closer to where we are. There is a slight rise in deaths and less recovered but the total cases is almost spot on.

Sunday did decline but we are back up today (obviously, more time will tell). I expect our hospitalizations to continue to climb as per the graph's progress. I added a new graph covering the percentage of daily positives compared to the daily testing. As many have mentioned, the total case increase and the active cases will climb solely on the fact that we increase testing (when that happens). So that metric won't tell the complete story.

Possible correct prediction by U of W model (see below) Bad News: Active cases and ICU use up. The most interesting part of today's update is to test the U of W model that predicted yesterday as the peak hospitalization use. Actually they predicted that peak would hit between April 10 - 18. As you can see hospitalization did go down today. We'll see if that is the trend or a statistical anomaly. I'm predicting the latter. But I would LOVE to be wrong. I've included two of their graphs. They are a little off on their predictions of MN Deaths. On April 15th they predicted we would have 112 deaths today. The actual number is 134.

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-16 13:50:11,"Why Testing is Important: On March 31, 2020, I made my first graph and report on the COVID-19 numbers in Minnesota. I did this because on March 15 and 16 the percentage increase was around 50% and if that continued we would be at a million cases in 3 weeks. This was not a good outcome. If this virus was as deadly as we thought (morbidity rate of 3.7%) we would have 37,000 dead Minnesotans.  As the rate of increase quickly receded, I was unable to reconcile the projections the Government was making regarding the growth of the virus. The numbers we were seeing and the trends we were watching didn’t match the explosive and exponential growth the Governor’s office was predicting. As we have seen over the past couple weeks Minnesota’s case load has been growing but at a very steady and linear manner. Our ability to manage an exponential growth in  cases has been materialized and we are well prepared - 2633 icu beds, only 103 used for COVID-19 patients.  https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response.jsp Why haven’t we seen more cases? I think it’s fair to say if you have any symptoms you get tested for COVID-19. We have tested 41,675 Minnesotans likely to have contracted the virus. Of that number only 1,912 (4.5%) have tested positive. We aren’t testing non-symptomatic patients but we are testing those most likely to have the virus. Of that subgroup, the number of cases remains very low Why aren’t there more cases in Minnesota? We have one of the lowest infection rates per capita in the US. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s Current trends point to a May 4th total of 211 icu beds, 358 hospitalized, and 1287 active cases. (see graph) There are 2 possiblities for this outcome. 1. The virus isn’t as virulent as we expected. 2. Minnesota’s Shelter at Home was implemented ahead of widespread dissemination and most of us haven’t been exposed to the virus yet. We won’t know which of the above possibilities or the spectrum between the two is true until we can test more of the general, non-symptomatic public for antibodies for COVID-19. If number 1 is the case, we have largely been exposed to the virus but 99% of us show no or little symptoms we should reopen the economy with great urgency. If number 2 is proven to be true we can still reopen slowly but need to watch the numbers. If the active cases number starts to exponentially grow we would need to reverse course and ease off the rate of reopening.  We need a process for businesses to appeal the Shutdown ruling and reopen if they can prove they can practice appropriate social distancing. We need this today! If a business can show they can practice social distancing with a  minimum of 113 square feet per customer they should be allowed to gradually reopen. That’s why these numbers and trends are so important. We need to know where we are and more importantly where we are headed. This is why testing is so important. Which situation are we in? Once the antibody test from Mayo and others has been administered in any sizable manner, we will know more and we will know how to responsibly proceed.  #WeAreMN",24,22,1,,,1,,,632526133966956,/story.php?story_fbid=632526133966956&id=398986710654234

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-14 13:15:34,One of the most common comments on our daily COVID-19 updates is that we need more testing. Here is the data on the tests completed in MN on those most likely to have the virus. Notice the lack of jump in positives on March 25 when we doubled the amount of completed tests. As the testing has grown the percentage of positives has held steady. We have not discovered a huge cluster of positives hiding in our populous.

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-09 22:05:13,"For the record, I am largely in favor of Governor Tim Walz  extending the Shelter at Home order for now but not for an additional 3 1/2 weeks.  I also think we should open up businesses at a faster rate, especially businesses where social distancing is possible. We need to be flexible and reactive as the data continues to improve. We still need to lower the daily additional cases and keep the growth percentage declining. Once we start opening up outdoor businesses like golf courses and all construction sites we can see how the numbers react. If we take some preliminary steps and don't see a surge in cases in 11 days, we can open up more. But for now, most of us should stay the course at least for a few more days. We also need to have open and honest modeling.  #WeAreMN (See our Reopening plan here - https://www.robbarrettforsenate.com/post/barrett-releases-post-covid-19-reopening-plan)",43,39,,,1,,3,,628221391064097,/story.php?story_fbid=628221391064097&id=398986710654234
"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate",,2020-04-09 13:47:12,"4/9 COVID-19 Update. Good news - ICU usage down, percentage growth down. Bad news - active cases up, deaths up.  There is a lot to digest here. The first page is the daily COVID-19 update. We're still doing great. Page 2 is a graph depicting what yesterday's MN State prediction would indicate as far as growth. They are predicting 3000 - 6000 deaths around the peak of June 2 (down significantly from previous predictions). If we use the low number, 3000 deaths, that would indicate that we have around 81,000 cases (3.7% mortality rate) by that time. As you can see by the chart, the rate of increase must grow significantly from the the path we are on. Note the current trend up through April 9. I would use their median prediction of 4500 deaths but then the graph is so out of proportion the current trend is undetectable.  Where are they finding evidence of such a marked increase in state that is already sheltering in place? Page 3 is an extrapolation of the path we are currently seeing with only modest increase. If this model is right we would have 6500 cases by June 2 and 200 deaths.  Page 4 is a look at what happened in Washington State. Why were we able to avoid what happened there?  The answer is our early closing of bars and events. While the closures happened at similar times (bars and restaurants, Mar 15 WA and Mar 16 MN, and Shelter in Place, Mar 23 WA and Mar 27 MN) the amount of cases already in circulation were drastically different. On Mar 23 WA had 232 new cases, on Mar 27 MN had 52 new cases. (Minnesota had effectively shut down significantly before that date.) We may also be doing a better job of social distancing. As you can see WA had a big spike in cases starting Mar 27 and continuing until just recently. That is why I think we Minnesotans should be able to understand how our leaders are coming to their conclusions. It's just a question of modeling and predictions. There should be nothing classified about it. A theoretical percentage increase should not be a classified secret.  If you've read this far you are a true policy wonk and I thank you for your time. Blessings to you and to the state of Minnesota. RBJ",25,22,,2,1,,,,628012787751624,/story.php?story_fbid=628012787751624&id=398986710654234

For 11 years I made videos and did TV and radio appearances showing families how to cook easy to make meals with very little measuring and using normal ingredients. The idea was to take your laptop into the kitchen and follow along. The video was the recipe. So If you're tired of cooking your normal goto recipes, here is a playlist of some of the easiest recipe videos from that chapter. Enjoy and let me know how it goes.

On February 25th all across Minnesota we will hold our precinct caucuses. This is the first step in the political system. At the caucus you can add planks to the platform of the party. You can also run to be a delegate at the BPOU convention. Basically if you are willing, you are in. At the BPOU convention you can run to be a delegate at both the CD (Congressional district) and the State Convention. The same delegates have the opportunity to go to both. At the state convention you get to decide which candidate for US Senate gets endorsement of the party. I would humbly ask that you vote for me. I believe I have the best chance at winning a statewide election in MN, something we haven't done in the past 23 attempts. We are 0-23. Let's try some fresh faces and fresh ideas.

,,2020-02-07 11:12:33,"How to Become a Delegate - a musical call to caucus. Why do a normal video explaining what it means to caucus and become a delegate when you can do it in song? This age-old question has finally been answered. We need you to be a delegate for us. On February 25th all across Minnesota we will hold our precinct caucuses. This is the first step in the political system. At the caucus you can add planks to the platform of the party. You can also run to be a delegate at the BPOU convention. Basically if you are willing, you are in. At the BPOU convention you can run to be a delegate at both the CD (Congressional district) and the State Convention. The same delegates have the opportunity to go to both. At the state convention you get to decide which candidate for US Senate gets endorsement of the party. I would humbly ask that you vote for me. I believe I have the best chance at winning a statewide election in MN, something we haven't done in the past 23 attempts. We are 0-23. Let's try some fresh faces and fresh ideas.

Over the past few days, America has come together to mourn the loss of Kobe Bryant and 8 other victims from a horrific helicopter accident. People from all backgrounds, races, ages, and states shared a moment of gut-wrenching shock as the news spread across the country.  It’s hard to find purpose in such an unimaginable tragedy. But seeing so much of America put our differences aside for just a minute gives me hope. Hope for unity.  Our country is incredibly divided right now, but let’s use this unexplainable situation to not forget how much we DO have in common.  In a time of trial and pain, let’s remember who we are as a country. Who we are as people. We share more than we think...and in this moment, we share the grief of losing 9 innocent American people.

,,2020-01-01 17:28:47,"Peace. I’ve been thinking a lot about that word. Peace. I’ve found my default hand sign is the peace sign. Peace. It’s so needed in our world. Peace in our families. Peace for our country. Peace for our planet. We need peace more than ever. But peace doesn’t just happen.  We have to plant it, water it, and let it grow. So what is our/my responsibility to grow peace? 1. Pray for Peace.  If you believe in God, pray for it. Pray for peace in our country. Pray for peace and healing in our nation. Pray for supernatural peace. Pray for wisdom in our interactions with others to promote peace and not polarization. Pray for peace for our leaders - ALL our leaders. 2. Practice Peace.  Before speaking, posting, liking, or commenting, ask if what we’re going to communicate will promote peace or division.  Let’s endeavor to diffuse and de-escalate confrontations rather than add fuel to the fire of our disagreements. Social media can be so destructive but it can also be a force for peace. Let’s use it for good in 2020. 3. Promote peace.  Blessed are the peacemakers.  Let’s honor those who are peacemakers.  Follow them, repost them, thank them and bless them. Let’s talk about peace more. Peace is a decision. Let’s make it.

"Rob Barrett, Jr. for US Senate,Rob Barrett Jr",,2019-12-16 18:37:24,There are so many wonderful towns in Minnesota and last night I enjoyed one of my new favorites. Long Prairie is about 2 hours north of the cities. You go up to Sauk Center (another wonderful town) and turn right. Long Prairie has such a charming downtown with fun shops and delightful restaurants. The meeting I spoke at was in Griff’s Pizza where they have a tasty buffet and they make their own gluten-free pizza from scratch. It was sad to see some of the stores boarded up. We need to help out these downtowns and main streets survive and thrive. We can figure this out. We can have a thriving and fair economy.

I like Jason, I used to listen to his show everyday. But I am undeterred. Here's what I wrote back. ""Thank you so much for reaching out. You are such a blessing to our party. I am touched that you would think of me. I am passionate about leaving a better world for the next generation. I am committed to balancing out the representation in the US Senate. I am driven to make this country a better place. I believe I am still the best candidate to help Minnesota become the best state it can be. I don’t believe Jason will do well in Hennepin Co and especially with women 40 - 64 who decide the race. I am in it ‘til the end. I'm not going anywhere. Even though my own party leadership is against me, I will persevere, I will fight to the end, and I believe I will prevail. Though the powers that be come against me, I will stay strong to the end. #four32 #immeasurably  Are you with me? Let’s do this together.  We are stronger together.
