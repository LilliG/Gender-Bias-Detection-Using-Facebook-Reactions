Diana Bray for Colorado,,2020-03-05 18:36:46,Just reflecting a little bit on the last couple days since the primary.  I think it would be a very big mistake to give up on Bernie.  Trump will beat Biden. Haven’t we learned anything from last time? Dianaforcolorado@aol.com￼,23,19,2,2,,,,2,1363431487194294,/story.php?story_fbid=1363431487194294&id=1083725765164869

Diana Bray for Colorado,,2020-03-04 16:57:49,"""I asked all nine who they were voting for. Only two would say. I can't say if that speaks to loyalty, fear or politics. Diana Bray said she backed Sanders, and Michelle Ferrigno Warren was all-in for Elizabeth Warren (no relation)"" I would like to see candidates declare who they are voting for ahead of elections. Why? Their choice says a lot about the candidate who is doing the endorsing. This is helpful information to voters. I am tired of politicians holding their cards so close to their chests in order to protect their own interests. It's selfish. As for Pete and Amy, I think that they deprived their own supporters by withdrawing right before the primary. They actually disenfranchised their own supporters by not giving them an opportunity to vote for their second choices.  Poor Form. This election season will only get weirder, no doubt.
