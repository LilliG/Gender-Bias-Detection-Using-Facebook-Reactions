"Senator Erica Smith for NC,Angelicia Simmons",Angelicia Simmons,2020-02-26 10:38:02,"There has been much discussion about the ad buys and interference done by Mitch McConnell's impish SuperPac, Faith and Power.  I guess I'm most confused because I understand the concept of ""divide and conquer"". This concept of ""divide and conquer"" - which means, ""the policy of maintaining control over one's subordinates or subjects by encouraging dissent between them"" - is the oldest trick in breaking up and scattering groups of people. mitch knows that Black women are the most loyal, and a very powerful voting bloc in NC for the Democratic Party (although we repeatedly get dissed by the NC Dem party). His ads are a demonstration of ""divide and conquer."" Confuse the Black women in NC about Senator Erica D. Smith's allegiance, encouraging dissent between them allowing us to maintain control. You see how he just did that? Haven't we seen this before? Don't fall for this!!! This ain't rocket science y'all...surely we are wiser than this and understand the tactics by the likes of a mitchell mcconnell. *smirks* These boys ain't never played fair.  Why you shocked and falling for the okie doke? Listen, SuperPacs can't donate directly to candidates or parties. They contribute by doing ad buys. Candidates, especially those candidates, that don't come to these political campaign streets locked and loaded with money, normally are unable to counter these ads by running similar counter ads. In essence, Senator Smith HASN'T, DIDN'T, WON'T RECEIVE ANY MONEY FROM THIS PAC! SHE CAN'T GIVE NOTHING BACK! If Senator Smith should ""denounce this ad by running a counter television ad,"" please ask yourself, have I donated to her campaign allowing her to use this option as a strategy. With that said, she has denounced and disavowed this meddling. And, just for those of us who still just don't get it, Senator Erica D. Smith has no allegiance, alliance with republicans, OR mitch mcconnell's faith and power pac. As Black women, let's let mitch know that Black women aren't weak candidates, they can win (even in a party that continues to disrespect them) and that he tried the wrong one!! Let's demonstrate what we think of his ad by showing up at the polls and casting our ballots for Erica D. Smith for U.S. Senate. SN: And just to let you know, now is not the time to think that you can educate me on why you feel she can't beat thom tillis. Please don't try me on this one.

"Senator Erica Smith for NC,Erica D. Smith",Erica D. Smith,2020-01-05 20:44:37,"My reaction to the recent killing of Iranian Gen. Soleimani: President Trump's actions lack the foundation of transparency.  Time and time again, the American people have been led down the garden path through the distraction and dishonesty of our current president.  Unfortunately 'alternative facts' have become the norm from President Trump and key members of his administration.  Now we are told, without evidence, that an ""imminent"" threat against American interests was the impetus for the mission to kill Iranian General Quasem Soleimani.  But there are too many documented instances of deception, distraction, and denial from this president. So what are we to believe? The lives of Americans around the globe and, more directly, the lives of our troops overseas, now hang in the balance.  President Trump's decision to not notify the 'Gang of 8' about the pending mission reveals his utter disdain for the separation of powers created in the US Constitution. Gen. Soleimani was an evil-doer. We all know that.  But President Trump‚Äôs impetuosity in his unilateral and uncollaborative action have single-handedly risked the destabilization of our allies, our interests, our economy, and our lives.  Our allies, without prior notice, are now forced to scramble to de-escalate a potential geopolitical crisis that could lead to war.  Our national and our international interests in the region and around the world are now thrown into a state of confusion, with Russia the potential beneficiary.  The price of crude oil has spiked, and the dollar has dropped to its lowest value in nine years.  And President Trump's impulsive conduct  has now put our troops in jeopardy of retaliatory attacks.  President Trump's actions continue to represent a clear and present danger to the security of our nation.  The House has already acted, with his impeachment.  Now, the US Senate needs to move forward with his removal hearing, with clear rules of evidence and witnesses, as have been provided with every other Senate impeachment trial in our nation's history.",39,35,,3,,,1,3,3948086115217485,/story.php?story_fbid=3948086115217485&id=853629447996516

No one, not even the President, is above the law. Impeachment exists as the only check on a corrupt executive. It does not have to be a crime, per se. However, it is clear that the President's actions create a clear and present danger to the security of our elections. His abject refusal to participate in the process and attempt to deny witness testimony by ignoring subpoenas subverts the rule of law.  Our laws are in place to protect us. They are also in place to provide necessary checks on corrupt lawmakers. We swear oaths to uphold these laws and the Constitution. We cannot set the dangerous precedent of allowing anyone to subvert these laws. Individual lawmakers and political parties will come and go. Our system of justice and our Constitution will remain, so long as we honor said oaths and the checks and balances put into place for the co-equal branches of government.  The most sovereign power in our nation is granted to THE PEOPLE. Our power resides in safe and secure elections. We must remain vigilant in protecting the sanctity and security of these elections at every turn.

Senator Erica Smith for NC,,2019-12-15 11:58:35,"Voter list maintenance (identifying and removing the names of voters who have died or moved out of state) is important, keeping the poll book up-to-date. But it is never a 100% error-free process, so when 200,000 names are removed, a few hundred to a few thousand valid voters may be disenfranchised without their knowledge. Knowing this, GOP operatives often attempt to force a state to rush the process (to increase the error rate) as an election approaches - as in this latest example of a GOP-led lawsuit forcing the state of Wisconsin to remove 200,000 names, more than a year earlier than it had planned to. https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/13/judge-orders-wisconsin-purge-more-than-200-000-voters-list/4412776002/ Trump won WI in 2016 by just 23,000 votes. Voters can protect themselves from being incorrectly removed from the rolls, but it requires diligence on their part: most states provide an online look-up tool allowing voters to check their voter registration status. In North Carolina, that tool is here: https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/ With North Carolina's primary election just 10 weeks away, you should be checking your registration status monthly, beginning *now*.

In other words, Trump tried to rig next year's election. As I said, the GOP has not contested this (although, of course, they describe it differently). When the trial moves to the GOP-dominated Senate, members will either vote according to the facts, or according to their Party affiliation. We can guess how Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC)--who is being primaried from the right and who the left describes as the most vulnerable GOP senator on next year's ballot--will vote. But... Why isn't the NC Democratic party--including local county chapters--organizing protests outside Tillis' statewide offices, demanding that he vote on the facts, not propaganda?

He should consult the law.  2) Tillis is supposed to be an impartial juror in an impeachment hearing.

So it shouldn't surprise us that he thinks an admitted criminal like the President is being ""wrongfully"" investigated. 4) Statements like this mean that Tillis believes the rule of law doesn't apply to the powerful.

Why does this matter, you ask?  1) It creates a compromised position for our head of state.  Everyone on that call knows that what he did was illegal, as does he. Any one of those people could have attempted to blackmail the president with this information. 2) It is highly illegal for a political campaign or candidate to solicit or receive anything of value from a foreign national. Foreign heads of state have their nations' interest in mind, not American interests. This is not some minor infraction/speeding ticket; it is the epitome of an impeachable offense. 3) The President blew the whistle on himself. He admitted to the crime. He released a record of the call. He went on the White House's south lawn and implored Ukraine and China to interfere, again. His personal attorney said he did it. His Chief of Staff admitted to withholding Congressionally appropriated foreign aid to fight the Russians unless Ukraine did what the President asked. Recent testimony by his diplomatic corps and political appointees corroborated all of it. George Washington said that the greatest threat to a new republic would be that of foreign influence. Our nation cannot withstand the efforts of our current president and his sycophantic minions to diminish the rule of law and system of checks and balances for their personal gain.

Senator Erica Smith for NC,,2019-12-15 11:58:35,"Voter list maintenance (identifying and removing the names of voters who have died or moved out of state) is important, keeping the poll book up-to-date. But it is never a 100% error-free process, so when 200,000 names are removed, a few hundred to a few thousand valid voters may be disenfranchised without their knowledge. Knowing this, GOP operatives often attempt to force a state to rush the process (to increase the error rate) as an election approaches - as in this latest example of a GOP-led lawsuit forcing the state of Wisconsin to remove 200,000 names, more than a year earlier than it had planned to. https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/13/judge-orders-wisconsin-purge-more-than-200-000-voters-list/4412776002/ Trump won WI in 2016 by just 23,000 votes.

I believe in a vibrant and fertile marketplace of ideas. Our government needs and deserves this intellectual vitality as we weigh the issues that impact your everyday life. Our national discourse has devolved into truth vs. fiction and the degradation of basic human decency. Children do not belong in cages. Americans do not deserve to be gaslighted. Democrats and Republicans are not one another's enemies and should not exist as such. To deem it so is to give a victory to dictators like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un whose dictatorships thrive in the chaos of free will and democratic governments. We must find ways to unite. I do not disparage a Republican just for being a Republican, just as a Republican should not disparage me only as a Democrat. But, if your policies are corrupt and indecent, I will call them out. If you cloak said indecent policies in your party veil, you bring the stain to your party. Drop the labels and lets work together on policies that ALL Americans, Democrats and Republicans, can unite behind. Rule of law, clean air and water, enough food for our children.

Let Go and Let God and Walk in your Anointing Instead of holding onto desperation, broken relationships and broken dreams.  Matt 6 and Luke 7 ‚Äî The woman with the oil who had a mission and purpose and assignment.  Don‚Äôt allow hardness and negativity of folk to freeze us in our assignments.  Jesus said to the woman ‚Äî‚ÄúBecause of your faith-you are now saved.

God‚Äôs anointing lets us walk into doors where we may not be wanted.

Enter in the gates ready; know our assignment and how to find our way where God wants us to go. Pressure and Curing brings out true flavor of our annointing.  God will use the hardness of our enemy to teach us about his goodness 3- God‚Äôs anointing will keep us moving when we get squeaky ‚Äî Example - WD -40 will keep us moving - lubricate to avoid the friction that comes with God‚Äôs anointing‚Äî Annointing helps us to keep moving.   Simon had hurt on the inside - we can overlook that hurt and focus on Jesus the healer.  There was hurt all around the room at the Pharisee‚Äôs house. People seeking to be healed in ways they didn‚Äôt even know.  Our anointing assignment can sometimes upset the establishment and tear down strongholds ‚Äî people will operate in their self-interest - we can use that crazy faith that won‚Äôt let us stop ‚Äî that keeps us moving.

Senator Erica Smith for NC,,2019-09-11 08:01:11,"This day will forever live in infamy. Everyone of us old enough can recount the details of this bright, blue-sky morning in America. None of us suspected that the course of our nation would forever be altered by heinous attacks on our homeland. America has continued to suffer greatly at the hands of Islamic Terrorism as we have waged an 18 year war against a brutal and hateful enemy. We honor the brave servicemen and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice of life and limb. We pray the conflict will soon be unnecessary so that we can build coalitions and not bombs; roads and not patrol routes; schools and not bases. Unless we are able to help rehabilitate these war torn nations for the civilians, their futures will be mired in tribal warfare and remain a breeding ground for hate as a tool of advancement. In doing so, we must strike a balance between global security and rehabilitation. Our alliances are more important now than ever, as the world continues to shrink. As global leaders in this fight, adhering to the fundamentals of global peace and security and the tenants of strength through superior moral doctrine is the only path forward. The world continues to await our presence in this manner. However, it won't wait forever. It is also incumbent upon us to prioritize the health and welfare of those who have waged this war for us. The 911 First Responders, Marines who were first into Afghanistan, Army and Navy who liberated Baghdad, and the rest of the Armed Forces dedicated to preserving America's safety and security. Armed conflict changes people. Veterans may return home alive and relatively intact, but they have been changed. Our duty and obligation as elected officials is to ensure that they receive all of the proper care they deserve upon their return. This includes unfettered access to healthcare and counseling. 22 Veteran suicides a day is an atrocious and disturbing statistic. Improving and easing access to mental health care should be a priority. Increasing the minimum wage so that a door gunner in a helicopter isn't relegated to welfare wages should also be the measure of our collective compassion. We prioritize the defense industrial complex, but neglect the boots on the ground. This is unacceptable and I will promise to work to change this. We cannot continue to leave them behind and we cannot afford to remain in a perpetual war. Harm's way should forever be a last resort, not a reflexive option.  The fight to preserve life and liberty at home continues. I hope that we can each ask ourselves how we have helped to perpetuate the vision of American greatness. Part of my vision for this relies on re establishing our position in the world through compassionate action. Rebuilding war torn nations with sustenance and grace while holding hostile foreign adversaries accountable for their actions is paramount. This is not a time to have slumber parties on American soil with our sworn enemies. This is the time to shore up historic alliances and coalitions, and forge ahead, together. The world needs us, but we cannot go it alone... God Bless all the women and men who have struggled to keep us safe. I hope I can honor the legacies and memories of those we have lost as a duly elected Senator. My priority will always be to do so.  We will never forget.",22,16,,4,,2,,,3556880857671348,/story.php?story_fbid=3556880857671348&id=853629447996516

Senator Erica Smith for NC,,2019-08-12 11:50:17,"Today the National Republican Party spent a ton of money attacking me in the US Senate race.  They have posted a billboard in Raleigh and are calling me ‚Äútoo liberal‚Äù for NC.

Senator Erica Smith for NC,,2019-08-09 11:52:08,"Please read my 7 Point Plan on guns and how we curb mass shootings in the USA.  As leaders, we have to be able to state what we stand for if we are going to enact reforms. I implore my opponents to have the integrity to clearly state their positions on this issue as well.  Within my first 100 days as your US Senator- I commit to file and advance common sense gun control legislation that includes: 1) universal background checks, including components of existing federal proposals with a 10 day waiting period for response; 2) a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks;  3) closing gun show loopholes/ retail to owner transfers/owner to owner transfers; 4) red flag limitations providing access for loved ones and family members to petition to remove firearms from owners during periods of incapacitation; 5) more resources for a public service campaign for all public buildings including schools and universities to advance awareness and embodiment of the Sandy Hook Promise program; 6) resources and public safety programs for increasing manpower, surveillance/intelligence on domestic terrorism including increased cybercrime monitoring and tracking of manifestos of white nationalist organizations and their members; 7) criminal justice reforms as it relates to prosecution and sentencing of domestic terrorists and serial killers. This reform should ensure that punishment is commensurate with the crime by including capital punishment in sentencing discussions for mass shooters. I am done with inaction.  I am not waiting for another shooting before demanding that the NCGA leadership debate and calendar votes for House Bill 86 & Senate Bill 565.  I am further writing Senators Burr and Tillis to call for a Chamber vote in the US Senate on HR 8 and HR 1112 which they have held up for more than 160 days.  We have to act. Children are dying and the tears of mothers are met with inaction and political gamesmanship from Senator Thom Tillis and the like.  I will work to make this country safer & you will always know where I stand as your Senator.  #e4us #WorkingForUs  Please support me in this effort.

As we prepare for a long weekend filled with families, friends and cookouts across our great state, I wanted to take a moment to honor the true meaning of Memorial Day.  Memorial Day is the day Americans come together to honor the many fallen heroes that have died while serving our great nation and fighting to ensure the beacon of freedom shines brightly both here and abroad.  In this day and age of 24 hour news cycles and seemingly endless, divisive rhetoric, Memorial Day becomes more than a holiday.  It serves as a reminder that we have a duty and a privilege to honor our fallen by working tirelessly to make this country better.  While we enjoy such fundamental rights as freedom of speech, we also have a responsibility to use these rights to uplift each other and leave our country in a better condition for our children.  As Abraham Lincoln stated, ""-- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""
