"Lawrence Hamm for US Senate,Jim Keady,New Jersey for Bernie Sanders",,2020-04-16 13:51:36,"This is what happens when you have a government that is bought and sold by big money special interests. Giant corporations and the rich get taken care of and Main Street small businesses and everyday Americans get the shaft.  This is NOT just Trump’s fault. Both parties have sold out to the money for decades and because of this, these are the policies we get.  This is why we need to start electing third party candidates to Congress who are funded and supported by truck drivers, nurses, grocery check out clerks, small business owners, and everyday Americans writ large. The Republicans and Democrats in office got there by selling out to the rich and powerful. We need people in the halls of power who can be OUR voice and fight for OUR families, OUR neighbors, and OUR small businesses.

"Lawrence Hamm for US Senate,Boomlennials for Bernie",,2020-04-16 04:35:32,"Ok, I will be honest.  Bernie's decision to suspend his campaign and endorse the presumptive nominee has thrown me for a mighty loop. Like so many of us who have been working our behinds raw in support of his candidacy, I have  struggled with those decisions and wavered.   At the same time, and borrowing from Bernie, let me make one thing perfectly clear.  The junior Senator from Vermont is no dummy!  I believe he is using the resources available to him in the current situation to the best of his ability.  And those resources are nothing to sneeze at! Without missing a beat, he encourages us to keep campaigning for him in the remaining primary states, and we are figuring out how to do it.  Check out Our Revolution, People's Action, and other targeted initiatives and get to work! Without missing a beat, he encourages us to support progressive candidates and organizations to strengthen our  position in legislative work on Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and many other issues.  Support AOC, Pramila Jayapal, Ro Khanna, Mark Pocan, and the teams they are building now! Support National Nurses United, the Sunrise Movement, and other great organizations on the front lines in the fight for a future we can really believe in now! And follow Bernie's lead, as he begins work with the experts who will lead the policy working groups, demanding that the 46th Administration of the United States accomplish what reality endorses from the bottom on up! Hear the Bern!! Feel the Bern!!! Be the Bern!!!! https://youtu.be/OCR5SQYmIGo?t=371",2,2,,,,,,,151185623089545,/story.php?story_fbid=151185623089545&id=102588774615897

"Lawrence Hamm for US Senate,Felix Lau,America for Bernie Sanders 2020",,2020-04-12 12:40:28,"If you haven’t voted for Bernie already in your primary, please do so safely by mail, if possible, when the time comes. Apart from the outside chance that Bernie can still win the nomination, it’s important for Bernie to assemble delegates so that he can maintain the rule changes he achieved in 2016, such as barring superdelegates from voting for presidential candidates on the first ballot. In order for him to have negotiating power, Bernie needs to receive at least 1,200 delegates — he has more than 900 now — so he can introduce minority resolutions. Bernie can also push Biden to commit to progressive appointments. The following article details how this works (excerpt): “The convention's purpose isn't just to officially choose a presidential ticket. At the national convention, the party also codifies its official platform and sets rules for the next convention. To do so, the DNC establishes standing committees on party platforms, rules, and credentials. Each committee must consist of 162 members, and each committee's membership is allocated proportionally by how many national delegates a candidate received during the primary. Therefore, Sanders' performance in the national delegate race will influence how many of his supporters will wind up on these critical committees. If he were to win enough delegates to proportionally receive 81 members on each committee, for instance, he would have a majority. He won't, but getting close to that number — or ensuring that the establishment wing doesn't get much more than that number — gives his wing of the party a tactical advantage while advocating for their policies and the contours of the 2024 or 2028 primary.  One of the most critical bodies in this process is the platform committee, which is responsible for drafting and recommending the official party platform to the Democratic National Convention.” ",2,2,,,,,,,149749853233122,/story.php?story_fbid=149749853233122&id=102588774615897
