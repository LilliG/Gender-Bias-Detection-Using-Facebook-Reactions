Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2020-03-04 17:40:45,"The results are in, and we have finished outside of the top two. It was a close, hard fought race that we should all be proud of. While this isn’t the result we had hoped for, I wanted to thank everyone who was a part of this campaign for believing in the power of us. Though we will not advance to a runoff, we accomplished something great.  This campaign was consistently underestimated. I ran as a progressive, as a Latina, and as a working mom. We ran this campaign unapologetically, and we all have so much to be proud of for what we’ve accomplished. We don’t accomplish anything without taking risks. This campaign was a risky proposition– but it’s nothing compared to the risks that I’ve asked Texan workers and families to take over the course of my career. It’s their courage that inspired me to run to represent our state.  This is just the beginning of the progressive Texas we are going to build together. Congratulations to MJ for Texas and Senator Royce West for advancing in the #txsen race.

In 2013, she was the keynote speaker at a Workers Defense Project event, where I had the opportunity to take this photo with her and my mom. Together, they've been two of my biggest role models. As a young woman, I remember reading about Dolores Huerta, and feeling empowered by her fearless leadership for our communities.  She stood up not just for farm workers and working-class Latinos, but also for the rights of women and the LGBTQ community. Dolores taught me the power of us. She taught me that even against daunting odds, we have the power to change the course of history, and that we can build a future with dignity and equal rights for all.

Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2020-01-10 18:19:18,Texans have been at the center of the fight to treat asylum seekers and refugees with humanity. That’s partly since 1 in 3 Texans are ourselves immigrants or children of immigrants– and because it’s the right thing to do. People across our state have shown courage and compassion by welcoming those fleeing their home countries and fighting for their rights– by rising to meet this moment instead of running away. They are much better representatives of our state's values than Governor Abbott. No state should be able to opt out of welcoming refugees. https://apnews.com/7329dbc3dcbf32534689831455fa4246,292,87,1,5,2,29,168,28,551267175462226,/story.php?story_fbid=551267175462226&id=196021640986783
Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2020-01-09 15:03:51,"I’m proud to announce that our campaign is adding to our policy platform by supporting Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s legislation on criminal legal reform, The People’s Justice Guarantee, and the fundamental six policy points behind it, known as the #JusticeGuarantee.  With over 2.2 million behind bars, we lock up more people than any other country on Earth.  We got to this point by building a criminal system that was more concerned with retribution than with justice; by building a system that disproportionately targets the poor and people of color; by keeping half a million Americans locked up for nonviolent drug offenses, while the lawmakers who helped put them there are now profiting off the legalization of Marijuana. I believe that we can have a justice system that seeks the truth, a system that treats everyone fairly. We can have a system that keeps our communities safe and our families together.  Together, we will build a justice system that lives up to its name. https://theappeal.org/cristina-tzintzun-ramirez-senate-peoples-justice-guarantee/",232,178,,54,,,,,550291955559748,/story.php?story_fbid=550291955559748&id=196021640986783

Iranians and Iranian Americans are being targeted by CBP. By any moral or diplomatic measure, Trump is putting us all at risk. Americans don’t want another endless war. We want a President that respects the sacrifice of military families by ensuring military action is a last resort.

Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2020-01-04 18:59:04,"I know that in this race one way I will be attacked is for my identity. And I'll be attacked from both sides- I know it will happen because it’s already started. Some people say I am too Latina, too Mexican. How can I represent the needs of all Texans given my background of working on behalf of Latino families? To them I answer: Yes, it's true. I have fought to protect the rights of Latino families– to make schools better, to tackle #studentdebt, to make jobs safer and better paid, to #keepfamiliestogether. But these aren't issues that just Latinos care about. They’re issues that matter to everyone. So representing the needs of Latino families doesn't make me disqualified– it actually makes me uniquely qualified to be Texas' next Senator. Others say I am not actually #Latina or Mexican at all because my father is white–that I am just using my mother's heritage to win votes. But this isn't the first time I have heard comments like these. My whole life people have tried to label me a certain way, to try and put me in a box. I know there is no singular way to be Latina, no singular way to represent my heritage and roots. I am proud to be a MC-Mexican (Irish and Mexican). Soy orgullosa de mis raíces Irlandesas, Mexicanas, Europeas y Indígenas. It's true I don't fit in any one box or one label. I am proud of where I come from and who it's made me. I know my story represents those of millions of people that don't fit into any particular box. By telling our stories and owning who we are, we change the ideas of who we can be and what we can do. And in #Texas, a state so diverse as ours, we have so many great stories to tell of who we are and where we come from– it’s what makes our state great.

Last December, Trump announced his “Remain in Mexico” policy, which forces asylum seekers at our southern border to await a U.S. court date from Mexico. It has had disastrous humanitarian results. Around 55,000 people have been impacted by this policy.  Asylum seekers come to our border seeking safety, and we’ve left them stranded, and often at risk of facing violence. In Matamoros alone, over 1.5K people are awaiting their court date in horrific conditions with little access to medicine, clean water, and food. I went to Matamoros not only to witness what’s happening, but also to recognize the courage and resilience of those who are fighting to have a chance to call this country home.

Usually people would only answer Selena, and the queen did speak for so many of us. But Selena has been dead for over two decades, her voice hasn’t been able to fight for us for a long time. In a state where Latinos make up 40% of the population, we simply don’t have the voice, power, or respect we deserve.

I must accept and fully own my gifts - like the gift of giving people the ability to see their own power, their full possibility. The gift of being able to bring brown, black and white folks together to see their common interests and common future.

Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2019-09-05 20:46:06,"Today, I’m proud to announce that I’m endorsing the Peace Plan for a Safer America by students and survivors of March for Our Lives. Gun violence is a rising epidemic. Every day that our politicians fail to act is a risk to our lives and the lives of our children. We need real gun reform, urgently.  The Peace Plan is a bold gun reform plan that includes a national licensing and registry system, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a national gun buy-back program. These are the kind of ambitious policies we need to address this crisis. If we demand anything less, we’re doing the NRA’s work for it. Politicians ask for too little when they stop at universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons. Yes, we need basic, commonsense gun reforms like those. But what we’re facing is a national crisis, and what we need is visionary leadership and bold reform.  Four of the ten deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have taken place in Texas. Dozens of Texans have been shot and killed in the places where they learn, pray, and buy groceries.  These are attacks not just on our friends, families, and communities – they are attacks on our freedom and way of life, on our right to watch our loved ones leave home without wondering whether they’ll be shot dead with a weapon of war. As a mother of a two year old son, I think constantly about the day my son is going to go to kindergarten, about how it will probably be one of the most harrowing, scariest days of my life because it will be the most dangerous place I will have ever sent my child. That’s why I’m taking my lead from the young people standing up to the NRA and its politicians. That’s why I’m endorsing a plan put forward by brave survivors of gun violence. We should expect nothing less from people who seek to hold public office. Our representatives should fight for the young people, victims of gun violence and their families, and Texans that are demanding change, and not the NRA. The tragedies in El Paso and Odessa and Midland are horrific beyond words. They are also sadly, utterly predictable. Our politicians have spent my entire adult life failing to act with the urgency and moral purpose necessary to end the epidemic of gun violence.  I remember as a 17-year-old after Columbine, thinking “What is wrong with our society that things like this happen?” Now I realize that the problem is with our politicians who care more about donations from the NRA and the gun lobby than American lives.  It shouldn’t – it can’t – surprise us anymore when mass shootings like El Paso, like Odessa and Midland, like Las Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, and Columbine happen.  This isn’t even the new normal; it’s the old normal. This is the predictable result of a political system that values the profits of the gun industry more than it values human life. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Millions of Americans agree that we need gun safety laws that keep our communities safe. But to force Congress and the President to take action, we need huge numbers of people to speak up now. Will you join me in demanding real action to end gun violence? Sign on to join me in supporting the Peace Plan by March for Our Lives.

Enough is enough. I’m angry. We should all be angry. While the President and our elected representatives like Sen. John Cornyn deny the reality of human-induced climate change, they’re putting our lives in danger by failing to pass legislation to mitigate its most harmful effects.  I’m running for U.S. Senate because I refuse to stand by and do nothing as our communities suffer devastation.

His name is José -- here’s a picture of us and his two beautiful daughters. I met José after moving to Austin. I had learned that some of the hardest working people in the city, construction workers, were frequently not getting paid for their work and were getting seriously injured on the job.  So I started organizing alongside workers like José to demand fair wages and working conditions. I found it outrageous that many were living below the poverty line even though they worked full time. That they were statistically more likely to die on the job than any other state.  While Texas politicians were out there bragging about the miraculous growth of the economy, for workers - who are the backbone of Texas’ economy - that economic “miracle” was a nightmare. So my colleague, Emily Timm, and I co-founded the Workers Defense Project to fight for economic justice. The people I met during my time at the Workers Defense Project taught me a lot about the kind of leader I want to be.

Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2019-08-17 18:26:51,"When Trump was elected, I was six-months pregnant with my son Santi. I cried in bed for several days after the election. Like millions of people across the country and around the world, I felt afraid and I felt angry – and, initially, I felt paralyzed. But then I got busy. I decided to organize a Love Trumps Hate event for my friends, family and neighbors to speak out against Trump’s hateful rhetoric.  It felt good to be in motion, to be working instead of just sitting around feeling afraid and angry. I figured that, if we were lucky, maybe a couple hundreds people would be there. Instead, over 2,000 people showed up to stand up for immigrant and Latino families like mine. That event was the start of Jolt, the organization I started and led since 2016. Since then, we’ve worked to protect the rights of immigrants and their families from attacks by the state legislature, advocated for college affordability, and registered and mobilized thousands of young voters of color. With a new baby on the way, it wasn’t really the right time in my life to start a statewide civil rights organization. But, when I thought about the ways the Trump raised the stakes for families like mine, it didn’t feel like there was any other choice but to get to work. I’m running for Senate because, when I imagine the world Santi is going to inherit, and the one I leave behind for him, I want him to be proud of what I stood up for. What we stood up for together.

I got to share a moment with these two incredibly powerful women – two women who have been role models for me throughout my life and who have taught me how to stand up for what I believe in: My mom, Ana, and labor leader Dolores Huerta. My mom taught me to be everything that I love about Texans: Big, bold, kind, generous, proud, hard-working, and, above all, to care for our family, friends, and community.  As an adult, I’ve carried those values with me everywhere. While I was getting my undergraduate degree in Austin, I started organizing with construction workers and co-founded the Workers Defense Project to help ensure that hard-working families could have good, safe jobs.  At the time this photo was taken, I was the Executive Director of the Workers Defense Project. Dolores had agreed to be the keynote speaker at an event we organized, and she spoke to us about the power of ordinary people to change the country.  As a young woman, I remember reading about Dolores in history books, and felt so empowered by her fearless leadership for our communities. She stood up not just for farm workers and working-class Latinos, but the rights of women and the LGBTQ community.  Dolores taught me the power of us. She taught me that even in the face of people telling us that we can’t do it, we have the power to change the course of history, and that we can build a future where all of us live with dignity and equal rights. #sisepuede",268,183,,84,1,,,7,446853212570290,/story.php?story_fbid=446853212570290&id=196021640986783
Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2019-08-14 15:46:31,"I want to share a little bit about who I am, where I came from, and what it taught me. This is a photo of me at age two (I’m the one in the middle holding the doll) with my mom and dad, my brother and sister, my great grandmother, my uncles, my aunt, and my cousin. My mom is to my right holding my sister, and that’s my dad right behind her. We were living in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas on Glenhaven Boulevard at the time. My mom’s the oldest of nine kids from a farm-working family in Southern Mexico, and my dad’s an entrepreneur from Ohio. Growing up in a mixed-race family in Oak Cliff and, later, Columbus, Ohio, I was a part of two very different worlds.  On my dad’s side of the family, we were white and middle class. On my mom’s side of the family, we were brown and working class. I remember how differently my siblings and I were treated when we would walk into a meeting with a teacher or a doctor appointment holding my mother’s hand, who was dark skinned and spoke English with an accent, than we were treated when with my white American father. That experience taught me an early and important lesson – that, in America, it’s often the case that the color of your skin or your family’s country of origin or how much money you make shapes in profound ways how other people treat you. But, for every lesson I learned about the things that divide us, I learned more about what we have in common and what brings us together.

Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez,,2019-08-13 20:22:41,"I love Texas. We're a big state, a politically important state, and an underserved state.  I'm running for Senate because I believe that we can lead the rest of the country and have the guts and courage to tackle the issues, not just that we face, but that the entire country faces. I decided to run because I want a government that actually serves our interests and our needs. A government that ensures people have access to affordable and high quality healthcare. A government that protects the rights and dignity of workers and immigrant families. A government that builds an economy that works for all of us, not just some of us. It would recognize the power of people coming together. And it would actively reject hate. We have to work hard, but my past work has shown me the power of us, every single one of us, when we come together. And that’s what we need to do now - elect leaders that will take on the largest problems of our time and recognize the power that we have in choosing them. A key to winning statewide in Texas will be running a campaign that mobilizes two key constituencies -- young people and Latinos. I've spent my career doing this and believe that if we win Texas, we change the country. We can change the way that our government works.  I’m excited to travel the state and hear from you about how I can best serve and represent you. It’s an honor to be in this race.

His name is José -- here’s a picture of us and his two beautiful daughters. I met José after moving to Austin. I had learned that some of the hardest working people in the city, construction workers, were frequently not getting paid for their work and were getting seriously injured on the job.  So I started organizing alongside workers like José to demand fair wages and working conditions. I found it outrageous that many were living below the poverty line even though they worked full time. That they were statistically more likely to die on the job than any other state.  While Texas politicians were out there bragging about the miraculous growth of the economy, for workers - who are the backbone of Texas’ economy - that economic “miracle” was a nightmare. So my colleague, Emily Timm, and I co-founded the Workers Defense Project to fight for economic justice.

Like millions of people across the country and around the world, I felt afraid and I felt angry – and, initially, I felt paralyzed. But then I got busy. I decided to organize a Love Trumps Hate event for my friends, family and neighbors to speak out against Trump’s hateful rhetoric.  It felt good to be in motion, to be working instead of just sitting around feeling afraid and angry. I figured that, if we were lucky, maybe a couple hundreds people would be there. Instead, over 2,000 people showed up to stand up for immigrant and Latino families like mine. That event was the start of Jolt, the organization I started and led since 2016. Since then, we’ve worked to protect the rights of immigrants and their families from attacks by the state legislature, advocated for college affordability, and registered and mobilized thousands of young voters of color. With a new baby on the way, it wasn’t really the right time in my life to start a statewide civil rights organization. But, when I thought about the ways the Trump raised the stakes for families like mine, it didn’t feel like there was any other choice but to get to work. I’m running for Senate because, when I imagine the world Santi is going to inherit, and the one I leave behind for him, I want him to be proud of what I stood up for. What we stood up for together. I want him to know that in a moment where 1 in 6 Texans didn’t have access to healthcare and millions were struggling just to make ends meet, when communities were being pitted against one another on the basis of race, and our world was at the brink of an imminent climate catastrophe, we came together and worked as hard as we could to make his life and other children’s lives like him better.",396,273,,122,,1,,11,447854185803526,/story.php?story_fbid=447854185803526&id=196021640986783
