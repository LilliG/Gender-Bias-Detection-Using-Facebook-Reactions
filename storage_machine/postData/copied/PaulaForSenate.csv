"Paula Overby for US Senate,Cam Gordon",,2019-08-23 18:27:39,"Here is a shout out to the Minneapolis City Council and the Sex Worker Outreach Project (SWOP).  A nation of laws ought to be a safe place to work!This morning, the Council unanimously passed the adult entertainment ordinance I coauthored, and that my office has been working on since 2017. My colleagues all even wore red to symbolize their support for sex workers. This is a major step towards improving the working conditions for some of the most stigmatized workers in our city: people, mostly women, who work in strip clubs. Among the protections this ordinance creates are: - A prohibition on managers and owners accepting tips from workers, in line with state law - A requirement that entertainers will be provided written copies of their contracts when they start working, and upon request - A suite of physical improvements to the club environments, including elimination of slipping and tripping hazards, more open and observable VIP spaces - Increased safety for workers, including mandatory escorts to their transportation at the end of each shift and prohibiting people who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes in the last five years from working as managers or security - Standardization of security camera policies, including a requirement to delete footage after 30 days - Required codes of conduct for patrons - Required training for employees on harassment and discrimination - Requirements that entertainers be given City-approved ""know your rights"" materials. All of these components were developed with a strong group of advocates, led by the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP). This win is as much theirs as anyone's - we could never have crafted such a good ordinance, so well aligned with the interests and needs of the workers, without them. Thanks so much to Jayne, Andi, Ramona and all of the other SWOP advocates who made this happen. Others who deserve a lot of credit for moving this forward include our Health Department and Licensing division and in particular Dan Huff and Linda Roberts, the Minnesota State University Mankato, the U of M's Urban Research and Outreach-Engagement Center (UROC), and my coauthor Linea Palmisano and her staff. As Jayne Swift from SWOP said after the meeting: ‚Äúwe know that law and policy alone cannot end economic exploitation or discrimination. But what this ordinance does is change the legal conditions so that workers can advocate for their collective best interests, and introduces accountability into their workplaces.‚Äù As I said at last week's public hearing, I did not campaign on tackling conditions at adult entertainment establishments. But as we dug into the issues happening at these clubs, I realized that I HAD run on this. In campaigns I have talked about building a fairer economy, making sure all workers have decent conditions and fair wages, fighting for social and economic justice. And that's what this ordinance is all about. I'm proud to have been able to be part of it.",3,3,,,,,,,2521770091379863,/story.php?story_fbid=2521770091379863&id=1459795827577300

"Paula Overby for US Senate,Ginger Jentzen",,2019-06-11 15:26:57,"Women have a choice that men don't have.  Men want to control that choice and deny women their personal freedom.I don‚Äôt know where this originated but it‚Äôs worth a read.  ## This is a repost from an ultrasound technician: Abortion issues  So here‚Äôs the thing: This Alabama-abortion-ban is a big deal, in a very bad way. Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm looking at you too, but we‚Äôre going to focus on Alabama. If you‚Äôve been living under a rock, let me catch you up. Alabama Governor, Kay Ivey, just signed a total abortion ban into law, the most restrictive law in the United States. The law will ban abortion at every stage of pregnancy for every reason. This is not okay, not reasonable, and definitely not acceptable. If you don‚Äôt know me well, maybe you don‚Äôt know what I do for a living. I‚Äôm an ultrasound technologist. My colleagues and I look at babies in every stage of pregnancy every day. I also work in a high risk unit. My unit and I look at babies and mothers in varying states of mental and physical health. If you think an abortion ban sounds good, then I am a good person to ask about why it isn‚Äôt. So let me tell you: About the woman whose baby developed with no skull, and the brain just floating around. Her baby still had a heartbeat, and she would not be able to access abortion. About the woman whose baby has a rare chromosomal condition called T13. Her baby‚Äôs organs grew outside its body, and had a cleft palate so bad that there was no nose. She would not be able to access abortion.  About the woman whose blood pressure is spiking so high that she passes out and is likely to stroke out before her baby is born. She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman with such a severe form of hemophilia that giving birth will probably be fatal to both her and the baby. She would not be able to access abortion. About the 13 year old whose school isn‚Äôt allowed to teach her science-based sex-education, so she didn‚Äôt know how to prevent pregnancy or STIs, but whose body is not developed enough to carry to term without being damaged. She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman who was raped by a friend who wanted to ‚Äúmake sure she got home safely‚Äù. She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman who has PCOS so only has periods every 3-4 months and can‚Äôt find a birth control that works for her. She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman whose abusive partner removed the condom without telling her (it‚Äôs called stealthing, and it happens more frequently than you‚Äôd think). She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman with the cornual ectopic pregnancy that isn‚Äôt reliably in the uterus, and could grow to a size that will kill her. She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman who has two kids she can barely feed already, and whose birth control just increased in price. She would not be able to access abortion. About the 18 year old who just started college and is going to be the first graduate of the family if she can just stay in school. She would not be able to access abortion. About the woman whose IUD slipped slightly and is now endangering both her and the pregnancy it was designed to prevent. She would not be able to access abortion. About the many, many, many women who just don‚Äôt want to be pregnant for reasons that are their own. Health issues, abusive relationships, financial issues, social issues. They would not be able to access abortion. Some of these might sound like reasonable exceptions to you. And you would be correct. But no one should get to decide what happens with another person‚Äôs body, not even to save a life. You need written permission from a corpse before life saving organs can be taken from them. You cannot be forced to donate blood, no matter how dire the situation. And no one else should get to decide what a woman does with her body, end of story. But it‚Äôs not the end of the story, is it? Because here‚Äôs the kicker: if you consider abortion to be a murder (and some people genuinely believe that!) then miscarriage can be second degree murder. And this is already happening all over the world - El Salvador, Ecuador, and the US of A. Women are being jailed for miscarriages and stillbirths because they might have done something to cause it. If you start down this path of jailing women and doctors for making healthcare decisions that affect no one but themselves, then you get women who don‚Äôt go to a doctor for a safe procedure and instead order pills online or use whatever metal instruments they can find to end their own pregnancies. Women who are honestly experiencing a miscarriage (which is medically called a spontaneous abortion, just fyi) will not go to their doctor for help. They will bleed out on their bathroom floors or die of septic shock. And I haven‚Äôt even talked about how this will disproportionately affect women of color, LGBTQA+ women, or trans men. This isn‚Äôt about the ‚Äúsanctity of life‚Äù anymore. It‚Äôs about controlling women.  We can control ourselves.",2,2,,,,,,,2463431927213680,/story.php?story_fbid=2463431927213680&id=1459795827577300
