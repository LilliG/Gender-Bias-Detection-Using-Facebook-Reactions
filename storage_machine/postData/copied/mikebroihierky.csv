"Mike Broihier for Kentucky,Mike Broihier for Kentucky",,2020-04-25 18:16:55,"I stepped up to run against Mitch McConnell because I was sick and tired of standing by and watching him hurt the people of my state. Kentucky deserves better than you, #CoronaMitch. We're going to beat you this November. #EasternKY #NothernKY #WesternKY #TeamKentucky #Louisville #LexingtonFriends, We’re facing the worst pandemic in living memory. As soon as things got tough, Mitch McConnell did what all great leaders do. He ran away. While Mitch was having cocktails with Brett Kavanaugh, I had already called on him to pass an emergency universal basic income and to stop blocking the House from helping Kentuckians survive this pandemic. By the time he got back to DC, a number of legislators and public officials — Democrat and Republican — had stepped back from partisan lines to join our cause. When our ad came out, The Courier-Journal called it “blistering” and “the toughest ad of the 2020 cycle.” It even provoked a flustered response from Mitch McConnell’s former campaign manager.  We know he didn’t like it. So we made another one. Chip in at www.MikeForKY.com/donate to show Kentucky our “Corona Mitch” ads. Upon his return to the Capitol, Mitch said he would support an emergency universal basic income stimulus and other critical measures he had previously opposed. We know he’s not supporting these ideas because he suddenly grew a heart. The fear of people losing their lives was not enough to get Mitch to do the right thing. Only the fear of losing his reelection — the fear that we instilled in him — got him to finally do right by the American people. Now is not the time for political games. Now is the time for action, and if he is too sheepish to act, I will hold him accountable. If Mitch McConnell needs to be afraid to finally do his job, then I’ll keep him scared for the next 8 months. And then we’ll win. Chip in at www.MikeForKY.com/donate now to help us keep Mitch Scared. -Mike",67,54,,13,,,,,707851383294087,/story.php?story_fbid=707851383294087&id=496341171111777

Don’t ya dare miss it.Republicans have been maneuvering to shut the Postal Service down for decades by heaping multiple financial burdens on it. Now, it’ll run out of cash in October due to the pandemic—and Trump refuses to provide any funding to keep it running. Why is the GOP determined to kill the Postal Service? Simple: Republicans want to allow private equity firms and giant corporations to privatize mail delivery, hike prices, and profit further off Americans. And a special bonus for the Republicans: Voter suppression—as we head into the general election, when in-person voting remains uncertain, the death of the Postal Service would eliminate any kind of vote-by-mail program, disenfranchising millions of voters in November. MoveOn is launching a digital ad campaign intensifying pressure on Congress to provide desperately needed funds for the Postal Service. We’ll run targeted ads in rural districts that would be hit hardest by the Postal Service shutdown—communities that Trump must win big to have any chance of re-election. Can you chip in monthly to launch the ad campaign and continue the fight to save the Postal Service all the way to Election Day?",34,23,,1,3,2,5,,706692913409934,/story.php?story_fbid=706692913409934&id=496341171111777

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2020-03-19 12:49:29,"Friends, We’re facing the worst pandemic in living memory. As soon as things got tough, Mitch McConnell did what all great leaders do. He ran away. While Mitch was having cocktails with Brett Kavanaugh, I had already called on him to pass an emergency universal basic income and to stop blocking the House from helping Kentuckians survive this pandemic. By the time he got back to DC, a number of legislators and public officials — Democrat and Republican — had stepped back from partisan lines to join our cause. When our ad came out, The Courier-Journal called it “blistering” and “the toughest ad of the 2020 cycle.” It even provoked a flustered response from Mitch McConnell’s former campaign manager.  We know he didn’t like it. So we made another one. Chip in at www.MikeForKY.com/donate to show Kentucky our “Corona Mitch” ads. Upon his return to the Capitol, Mitch said he would support an emergency universal basic income stimulus and other critical measures he had previously opposed. We know he’s not supporting these ideas because he suddenly grew a heart. The fear of people losing their lives was not enough to get Mitch to do the right thing. Only the fear of losing his reelection — the fear that we instilled in him — got him to finally do right by the American people. Now is not the time for political games. Now is the time for action, and if he is too sheepish to act, I will hold him accountable. If Mitch McConnell needs to be afraid to finally do his job, then I’ll keep him scared for the next 8 months. And then we’ll win. Chip in at www.MikeForKY.com/donate now to help us keep Mitch Scared. -Mike",65,45,,12,2,,6,,681537512592141,/story.php?story_fbid=681537512592141&id=496341171111777

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2020-03-15 09:20:40,"Team, Our staff is still in the process of getting home and settled in, but I’m happy to report that adapting to the circumstances of our public health situation has not slowed the campaign’s progress — it just looks different now. Most of our in-person events with voters were canceled by this weekend, and we expect them all to be. However, we’re reaching out now to all of the organizations that have worked hard to get them scheduled. Just because we can’t meet with voters in public doesn’t mean they should have to go without hearing from their options in this primary. Our team will be working to set up digital town halls to make up for as many of the canceled events as we can. In addition to adapting our time with voters, we also want to continue our relationship with volunteers and provide ways for them to stay invested in our campaign. We have a general idea of how this will work, but I’ll save the specifics of that conversation for when we have everything set in stone. Part of what volunteers will be doing is helping the campaign promote our presence online as Digital Ambassadors. If that is something that interests you as we continue our mission of retiring Mitch McConnell, here is a link to sign up and join us. On the media side of the campaign, we were recently featured in Fast Company Magazine’s story on a growing movement for a UBI Stimulus plan, which would provide financial assistance so that folks living paycheck to paycheck can stay financially secure as the role of work changes. We also have similar and exciting media opportunities brewing. Keep an eye on these posts to hear more as we’re prepared to make announcements. In case you missed my video yesterday, I touched on how our campaign will change moving forward to adapt to the coronavirus outbreak. I hope you all stay safe and connected with loved ones. If you are in the position to give to the campaign at this time, your contribution will go towards this new approach for the campaign. We plan on reaching as many voters as we can, and with recent changes to daily life, the way to do that has changed, as well. Chip in at MikeForKY.com/donate to make sure Kentucky voters know that our campaign is the one best positioned to remove Mitch McConnell from the US Senate.

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2020-03-14 08:19:12,"Hey everybody, Mike Broihier here. I’m writing to you from the Chicken Bristle Farm here in Lincoln County, KY. In case you don’t know me, I’m a farmer, a former teacher, and a retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel running for Senate in Kentucky against Mitch McConnell. I’m writing this because I wanted to speak with all of you about this pandemic we’re facing. This is a time of fear and uncertainty. A global pandemic like this is something that is unparalleled in our country’s living memory. It’s an alarming time for all of us. Lynn and I have faced threats of many kinds across the world as Marines, but we have never faced a threat like this. This pandemic affects all of Kentucky and our entire country. Everyone is hunkering down and attempting to weather the storm together. And I am confident we will get through this together, but it has made me change the way we are running this campaign. In times like these, we think of family. And the coronavirus outbreak has had an outsized effect on our campaign team. We have staff from all over the country who have moved to Kentucky to help us win this race. They all have families who are concerned about their well being. We have to take care of them. No longer can we hold town halls and meet-and-greets. Our staff is now working from home. The entire setup of our campaign has adapted to fit this new world order. In a period like this, when the country is undergoing such a crisis, and people are in survival mode, the question arises: should we keep running this race? And the answer is, absolutely, yes. We must. For me and Lynn, this pandemic has only strengthened our resolve. It has only deepened our dedication to the critical mission of defeating Mitch McConnell. Here’s why. When Donald Trump was elected, there was one man with the power to check his authority: Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell decided it was worth risking an incompetent executive like Donald Trump — in order to get far-right conservative judges on the bench and corporate tax cuts signed into law. Mitch McConnell decided it was worth risking our national security and our democracy — just to notch partisan victories for corporate interests and the Republican Party. Mitch McConnell decided we could survive an incompetent President and incompetent administration. Well, this outbreak proves one thing: Mitch was dead wrong. Because Mitch put party over country, the coronavirus has spread farther and faster than it ever should have. Tests were not available when they should have been. Information has been dispensed inconsistently and inaccurately.  And now we are paying the price. We all are paying the price. Mitch chose his political power over us, and now Kentuckians will die as a result. But instead of working to save lives, Mitch fled Washington for a three-day weekend — just to take Brett Kavanaugh around to fancy political dinners in Louisville. We can’t count on Mitch. We can’t elect someone like him ever again. He must be replaced with someone who actually cares about us. That’s why I’m fighting harder than ever to win this race. But, for us to win, we need the funding to compete in the Democratic primary and the general election. Now, it feels wrong to fundraise during a period of crisis like this — but after long hard thought, I realized that this mission is not just about surviving Coronavirus, but preventing the next crisis. And to do that, we must take down Mitch McConnell. We cannot give in. To give in during a crisis like this would be to let Mitch win. I can’t do that. We can’t do that. So, to those of you who are in a position where you are able to contribute, I ask that you give whatever you can to this mission to help us beat Mitch McConnell. The place to do that is at MikeForKY.com/donate We’re setting an ambitious but necessary goal of raising $500K by the official FEC filing deadline on March 31st. That’s an aggressive goal, but we believe we can do it, together. Please consider donating at MikeForKY.com/donate To those of you who are not in a position to contribute during this time, I completely understand. Know that you are no less of a supporter, no less a member of this team. You are just as important as anyone else in our mission to defeat Mitch McConnell. In fact, if you cannot give, you can help in other ways. You can help us share our content across Facebook, Twitter, email, and text . You can help us spread the message to as many of your friends and family as possible. With our campaign going forward being 100% digital and remote, sharing content is going to be critical to winning. To join our army of content-sharers, please click here. Together, I am confident we can weather this pandemic and make Mitch McConnell pay for the unnecessary suffering he has caused all around us. As a country and a commonwealth, we can say loudly and clearly that we are sick and tired of letting him ruin our lives, damage our democracy, and put our loved ones in harm’s way. From here on out, I’ll be sending you a daily campaign update — right here, just like this, from me to you.  No edits, no poll-testing, no message refining from consultants. Just a campaign update from the Chicken Bristle Farm. I’ll tell you what we’re doing, who we’re talking to, and the progress we’re making. I’ll also tell you how Lynn and I are holding up, and when the asparagus crop starts coming up. After all, in times like this, we should never be alone. So as you hunker down during this season of doubt, join me in this mission. Don’t be alone. Be a part of something. Let’s do this together. It’s an honor to be your candidate. Mike P.S. Thank you for reading. I’ll be sending updates like this once every morning.

It's hard to process just how fast Sen. McConnell and his entire caucus became comfortable with two things: a lack of any semblance of fairness and the uncanny ability at turning a blind eye to evidence in witness testimony. But this isn’t news, not to us here in Kentucky— this is business as usual from the Majority Leader's office. We are going to put every resource we have into making sure this was Mitch's final chance to be the sand in the gears of the U.S Senate. ‪November 3rd, 2020‬ is coming right at him and Kentucky is ready to move on.

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2020-01-25 08:00:12,"Coal companies and the political establishment in D.C. have more in common than meets the eye. Too often both are guilty of turning their backs on the very people that made them what they are.  As coal companies continue to try and get out of paying miners’ their hard earned wages, the political elite treat blue collar folks across Kentucky as a commodity that can be used and tossed aside. Washington D.C. has never acknowledged Appalachia, but Mitch McConnell seems to have forgotten his raising.  We need someone in Washington that both understands and represents the needs of everyday people, and that person is Mike Broihier.

He freely accuses me of having ""socialist fantasies"" to scare Kentucky voters but complains when he is called out for resisting attempts to inform the nation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and for exchanging in-place sanctions on a criminal Russian oligarch for a pork barrel project in his home state. Finally, he claims he is immune from scrutiny because he is a ""Cold Warrior."" For those of us who know McConnell's history, he is anything but a warrior. Warriors put their lives on the line for what they believe in. The McConnells of the world happily send others parents, children and spouses off to fight their ideological battles.

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2019-08-11 08:46:10,"Military exercises in the Republic of Korea are not “ridiculous,” despite the President’s recent comments, and I’d argue are critical for a successful deterrence to North Korea aggression.  I participated in exercises in the ROK throughout the 80’s and in 2000 started a two-year assignment in Seoul as the Marine Forces Korea war planner (MARFORK-ACS G5) and keenly appreciate the challenges of defending a country whose capitol and it’s 13-million citizens are within artillery and rocket range of a blood thirsty and vicious regime. First and foremost, we need to understand that the defense of the ROK is unlike any other US military partnership. It is not a US-led coalition with our South Korean allies playing a subordinate role; it is a full-on partnership with the ROK bearing most of the burden in lives and treasure. Our ROK allies are earnest and selfless and will bear a disproportionate burden in blood if the President’s ill-considered words embolden the North Korean dictator to attack. Effective coordination in a complex battlespace across language and cultural divides requires constant tending and exercising command and control, mobilization and deployment of forces are critical for success.  Though it’s fallen into fashion lately to exonerate him, Dean Acheson address to the National Press Club in 1949 failed to include South Korea in a list of our defensive priorities in the far Pacific; six months later, North Korea attacked. The signaling the president is now engaged in is far less nuanced than Acheson’s and, considering his outspoken affection for the North Korean dictator, dangerous to a great friend and ally.  I’ll leave you with this thought. The day after 9-11, I exited work after 24-hours of trying to assess the impact on the peninsula of the attacks on US soil to find that the ROK Marine Corps had placed a physical barrier between the MARFORK headquarters and the adjacent road.  Our HQ was literally within spitting distance of a main thoroughfare through the capitol and ROK Marines had, unsolicited, lined that wall with their bodies and armored vehicles. Placed themselves physically between we who worked unknowingly behind a brick wall and some as yet unknown threat. Those young Korean Marines stood a lonely vigil throughout the long winter that followed without complaint or recognition. That, to me, is a worthy ally and friend.",149,77,2,1,15,8,46,,512426426169918,/story.php?story_fbid=512426426169918&id=496341171111777

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2019-07-30 18:46:55,"My friends, I’ve spent a lot of time overseas. I’ve lived or worked, at one time or another, in countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. When I’d meet young people, I’d always ask them, “What do you think of America?” Their answer most often was, “I dream of America.”  They weren’t speaking figuratively. They literally dreamt of our country. The dreamt of freedom, safety, democracy, opportunity, education and equality. To them, that was America. Yesterday, news surfaced that Kentucky’s other perpetual embarrassment, Rand Paul, decided to insult Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) saying he’d buy her a plane ticket back to Somalia so she could learn to “…appreciate America more.” What Paul doesn’t understand is that Omar, who came to the US from Somalia via a refugee camp in Kenya, doesn’t need a lesson in appreciating America because she knows what it is supposed to be. She fled a war-torn, starving nation and spent four years in a camp; I bet, dreaming of America.  That she see’s in America’s economic, racial, social and political schisms a threat to the American dream, or the dream of America, and is willing to speak out about it is the most patriotic thing she could be doing.
