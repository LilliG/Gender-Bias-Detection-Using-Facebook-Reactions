Bush For Senate,,2020-01-20 11:03:51,"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He took his message of racial equality to the doorstep of the “People’s House,” bringing the Civil Rights Movement—and ultimately human rights—into a new era. From 1958 to 1965, Dr. King and fellow civil rights leaders met with Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson at the White House to advocate for full citizenship rights for African Americans. Dr. King’s work led to landmark civil rights and poverty legislation. In 1964, Dr. King came to the White House East Room to witness President Lyndon B. Johnson sign the Civil Rights Act, which guaranteed equal access to public places and outlawed racial discrimination. Tragically, Dr. King was assassinated less than four years later, in 1968. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the bill that created a federal holiday in honor of Dr. King. In 1994, President Bill Clinton declared it a national day of service, calling on Americans across the nation to continue to fulfill Dr. King’s dream through good works and volunteering.",17,15,,2,,,,,128200498674499,/story.php?story_fbid=128200498674499&id=105334957627720
