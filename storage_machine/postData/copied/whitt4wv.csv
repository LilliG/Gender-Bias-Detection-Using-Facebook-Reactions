I'm so pleased that she is sponsoring this great bill. But we can't forget her record on life.  Why won't she bother being pro-life in a non-election year?

Moreover, she has repeatedly stood against the pro-life cause with her actions, and her votes. Last week, she refused to sign an amicus brief asking the SCOTUS to reconsider Roe v. Wade, because she has stated she believes that it was rightly decided.  In 2013, she was one of 3 GOP Senators who blocked the vote to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Obamacare in 2017. In 2018, she refused to take a position on Amendment One in WV, which protected unborn life from state-funded abortions. She voted against the Hyde Amendment.  She voted 6 times for federal funding for abortions.  She voted 3 times against prohibiting federal funding for abortion.  Capito's votes show she is whole-heartedly in favor of taxpayer dollars going to fund abortions.  Shelley Moore Capito is on the wrong side of the greatest civil rights fight of our time--the right of unborn children to live.

Allen Whitt for U.S. Senate,,2019-11-02 11:09:40,"We need to talk about this new #guncontrol bill, s.2690, the ""RESPONSE Act,"" co-sponsored by Shelley Moore Capito.  The ""RESPONSE Act"" punishes “unlicensed” firearms dealers in order to ensure private gun sales go through a NICS background check, even though states who have implemented universal background checks have a 15% higher per capita rate of mass shooting deaths. This basically creates a “nationwide task force” designed to spy on and punish law-abiding gun owners who build and sell their own firearms. Do law-abiding Americans really need their names on another deep-state watch list? Furthermore, parts of the bill provide encouragement for social media platforms and users to report individuals they think might pose a threat to themselves or others, making already existing Gun Confiscation (Red flag) laws even more easily abused. Even when no crime has been committed, this bill allows for putting private citizens on watch lists and taking their lawfully owned property away.  Furthermore, there's a serious concern about the privacy of children under this legislation. Individuals on the left and right are concerned about government surveillance of children, and there's no evidence that this will mitigate the problem of school shootings.  The ""Response Act"" is a bill co-sponsored by 6 Republican senators. 5 of them are up for reelection in 2020, including my opponent. I urge you to call their offices and make your voices heard. #WhittforWV",5,5,,,,,,,132300818179058,/story.php?story_fbid=132300818179058&id=110759923666481

Allen Whitt for U.S. Senate,,2019-10-07 23:50:05,"Conservative leader Allen Whitt has announced his candidacy for the United States Senate. He will be challenging sitting incumbent Shelley Moore Capito for the Republican nomination. A former writer and spokesperson for Dr. Billy Graham, Allen Whitt has served for the past six years as the President of the West Virginia Family Policy Council. In that role, he has had a long record of defending West Virginians’ first amendment rights. He has also been a tireless advocate of the right to life. Over the past half-decade, Allen has been one of the most prominent conservative voices in the Mountain State, consistently championing conservative values and vetting Republican candidates for the West Virginia Republican Party. “I’m running to bring West Virginia values to Washington,” Allen says. “As a Republican, I campaigned for Shelley Moore Capito in 2014, but conservatives have been let down too many times by her votes and her statements. Her most recent comments on supporting red flag laws simply don’t represent the views of the majority of West Virginians.” For more about how you can get involved in our campaign visit our website: www.whittforwv.com.",5,5,,,,,,,111144453628028,/story.php?story_fbid=111144453628028&id=110759923666481

Allen Whitt for U.S. Senate,,2019-11-02 11:09:40,"We need to talk about this new #guncontrol bill, s.2690, the ""RESPONSE Act,"" co-sponsored by Shelley Moore Capito.  The ""RESPONSE Act"" punishes “unlicensed” firearms dealers in order to ensure private gun sales go through a NICS background check, even though states who have implemented universal background checks have a 15% higher per capita rate of mass shooting deaths. This basically creates a “nationwide task force” designed to spy on and punish law-abiding gun owners who build and sell their own firearms. Do law-abiding Americans really need their names on another deep-state watch list? Furthermore, parts of the bill provide encouragement for social media platforms and users to report individuals they think might pose a threat to themselves or others, making already existing Gun Confiscation (Red flag) laws even more easily abused. Even when no crime has been committed, this bill allows for putting private citizens on watch lists and taking their lawfully owned property away.  Furthermore, there's a serious concern about the privacy of children under this legislation. Individuals on the left and right are concerned about government surveillance of children, and there's no evidence that this will mitigate the problem of school shootings.

Allen Whitt for U.S. Senate,,2019-10-07 23:50:05,"Conservative leader Allen Whitt has announced his candidacy for the United States Senate. He will be challenging sitting incumbent Shelley Moore Capito for the Republican nomination. A former writer and spokesperson for Dr. Billy Graham, Allen Whitt has served for the past six years as the President of the West Virginia Family Policy Council. In that role, he has had a long record of defending West Virginians’ first amendment rights. He has also been a tireless advocate of the right to life. Over the past half-decade, Allen has been one of the most prominent conservative voices in the Mountain State, consistently championing conservative values and vetting Republican candidates for the West Virginia Republican Party. “I’m running to bring West Virginia values to Washington,” Allen says. “As a Republican, I campaigned for Shelley Moore Capito in 2014, but conservatives have been let down too many times by her votes and her statements. Her most recent comments on supporting red flag laws simply don’t represent the views of the majority of West Virginians.” For more about how you can get involved in our campaign visit our website: www.whittforwv.com.",5,5,,,,,,,111144453628028,/story.php?story_fbid=111144453628028&id=110759923666481
