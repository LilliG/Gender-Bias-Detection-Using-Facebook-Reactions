Eric Rothmuller,,2020-02-12 15:28:31,"I'm often told how politically divided America is. I disagree. The truth is that the American people are united on policy. If you go issue for issue, the majority of Americans want to get money out of politics, end corruption, combat climate change, end wars, provide universal healthcare as a right (Medicare For All), make the rich to pay their fair share, provide tuition free public college, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, etc. When we make it about the issues and put policy front and center, we win. After all, politics is about policy. If we're not here to get real legislation passed that solves actual problems and benefits normal American's lives, I'm not sure why any of us would be here. When we stand together and fight against the moneyed interests that run Washington DC, we can pass real legislation that transforms this country into one that works for all of us instead of just the 1%.

Eric Rothmuller,,2020-02-03 16:26:02,"Research from the political science field has clearly shown that the bottom 90% of income earners in America have virtually no say in legislation passed by Congress. Why do we have a Congress that doesn't represent the views of normal Americans? It's actually quite simple. In congressional races, the person with the most amount of money wins over 90% of the time. Overwhelmingly that's the corporatist candidate whom is viewed as a good investment from the corporate class and takes all of that big money. And let's be clear, what corporations and the donor class want are inherently against what workers and normal Americans want. We need to get money out of politics and implement a publicly financed election system so politicians are forced to represent their constituents instead of their donors in order to get elected. #GetMoneyOutOfPolitics #Democracy #Congress #PubliclyFinancedElections #USA #Representation",10,9,,1,,,,,188283139205478,/story.php?story_fbid=188283139205478&id=102699614430498

Eric Rothmuller,,2020-01-15 13:23:22,"We pay the most in the world and don’t have the best health care outcomes. Our heath care system is a disaster that leads to more debt, untreated sickness, and declining life expectancy. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s time we join the rest of the industrialized world in providing universal single payer healthcare (Medicare For All) to all of our citizens. The profiteering health insurance industry that gets between you and your doctor in it’s current form needs to be eliminated. The United States needs to be the sole single payer of insurance and must negotiate prices with healthcare providers and the price-gouging pharmaceutical industry. We have a healthcare system that currently provides us with the following: – Americans pay far more per person than the rest of the world for their healthcare. – 45,000 Americans die each year due to a lack of health insurance. – 87 million American adults in 2018 were uninsured or underinsured. Almost one in every two adults not currently on Medicare either has no insurance or has unreliable insurance. – 36 million Americans skipped a recommended treatment, test, or follow-up because of costs. – 37 million American adults in 2018 didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. – 40 million Americans didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs. – 57 million Americans had trouble covering their medical bills. – Medical bills contribute to 500,000 Americans going bankrupt every year. – The average American family of four with employer-sponsored insurance spent $12,378 in 2018 on employee premium contributions and out-of-pocket costs. This figure increases each and every year. – The health insurance industry sent at least 1,212 lobbyists to Washington DC in 2017 (over 2 lobbyists per member of Congress) and reports record profits to the tune of billions of dollars every quarter and the profit line keeps rising every year. – The pharmaceutical industry sent at least 1,490 lobbyists to Washington DC in 2017 (over 2 lobbyists per member of Congress) and reports record profits to the tune of billions of dollars every quarter and the profit line keeps rising every year. – $482 billion was spent by Americans on medicine in 2018. This is more than all European countries combined and comes out to roughly $1,479.00 for every single person in the United States. American’s know they’re getting ripped off. Polling shows that only 9% of American consumers believe the pharmaceutical industry puts patients over profits and only 16% believe health insurers put patients over profits. Polling also shows that 72% of Americans say that drug companies have too much influence in Washington. The United States is the richest country in the world. There’s more wealth in this country than any other country on the planet. If the rest of the industrialized world can provide a more efficient healthcare system with better results, there is no reason we can’t. We have the means to do it. It’s just whether we have representatives that are brave and principled enough to stand up to the healthcare giants and big pharma. We need representatives that will stand up to their army of lobbyists and millions of dollars worth of attack ads. Representatives that will fight for legislation with the American people in mind instead of their donors. We can do it and it all starts with your vote for a better congress and your advocacy for issues like Medicare For All. What I Will Fight For: I will support and vote for legislation that makes the United States join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right through a Single Payer Medicare For All system. I will support and vote for legislation that gives the government the ability to negotiate procedure costs and pharmaceutical prices with health care providers and big pharma in order to lower costs. I will support and vote for legislation that aims to limit or eliminate direct lobbying efforts (including donations) of the health insurance and pharmaceutical industry to members of congress, their staff, and anyone running for elected office. Here are a some bills in this field that I fully support: I support the Medicare For All Act of 2019 (H.R.1384 & S.1129) which provides a single payer health care system that covers every resident of the United States of America. I support the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act which allows patients, pharmacists, and wholesalers to buy prescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries. I support the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act which lowers prescription costs by pegging prescription drug prices to the median price in Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan. If the price is deemed excessive, HHS will void any government-granted exclusivity; issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. #MedicareForAll #KentuckySenate #SinglePayer",2,2,,,,,,,174558610577931,/story.php?story_fbid=174558610577931&id=102699614430498

With that said, here is my personal opinion on how you should go about choosing a candidate: 1. Make it about Policy. Politics is about policy because policy is what effects all of our lives. Look at the details of a candidates plans, not the empty rhetoric or excessive pandering. 2. Recognize that how your Representative votes and what they fight for is the most important thing they do. That's your vote and your voice being represented. 3. When looking at who to trust, do so by judging their campaign funding and political record, not by their personality or speaking ability. Look for candidates whom reject Super PAC money, Corporate PAC money, and refuse to do big bundling fundraisers. 4. When ultimately deciding on who to support, don't do it by whom you're told is electable and whom isn't. Support the person that you feel best represents you on policy and that you would trust to represent your interests and your voice.",2,1,,1,,,,,171997684167357,/story.php?story_fbid=171997684167357&id=102699614430498
