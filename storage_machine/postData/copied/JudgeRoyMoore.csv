"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2020-02-21 09:44:50,"FOUNDATION:  “DON’T VOTE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO  VOTE!”  MONTGOMERY: The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama organization dedicated to the strict interpretation of the Constitution as intended by its Framers and to the defense of traditional Judeo-Christian values, urged Alabama voters to reject Amendment One in the primary election March 3.   Currently, members of the State Board of Education are elected by Alabama voters by district.  If passed, Amendment One would abolish the right to vote for school board members.  Instead the Governor would appoint school board members subject to the confirmation of the Senate.  The amendment also mandates course of study standards that ensure nationwide consistency.  Foundation President Kayla Moore explained the Foundation’s position:  “Parents of school-age children are rightly concerned that schools teach the right values to their children and that school funds be spent wisely.  That can best be done when school officials are chosen by the people who raise the children and pay the taxes.  The State Board makes important decisions about the education of children, and Board members should therefore be responsible directly to the people.”  Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe predicted that Amendment One would be defeated: “However proponents want to spin it, the plain fact is, Amendment One asks us to give up our right to vote for members of the State Board of Education.   I don’t think most Alabamians want to do that, especially when there is no reason to believe an appointed school board would result in better education.  If Alabamians really understand what Amendment One is all about, I think most will vote ‘No.’”",50,40,,10,,,,5,1254493418082220,/story.php?story_fbid=1254493418082220&id=209038435961062

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2020-02-19 18:30:17,"FOUNDATION PRAISES ELEVENTH CIRCUIT’S DECISION IN PENSACOLA CROSS CASE  MONTGOMERY, AL:  The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama nonprofit organization dedicated to the defense of religious liberty and the strict interpretation of the Constitution as intended by its Framers, praised the decision of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in City of Pensacola v. Kondrat’yev as a significant victory for religious liberty.  In the City of Pensacola, Florida, a cross stood in a public park since 1941. For nearly 75 years, nobody complained, until several people sued because they were offended by the display. The trial judge reluctantly held that the cross had to be removed, saying that he was bound by past court precedents. The Eleventh Circuit reluctantly affirmed for the same reason. Shortly after that, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in American Legion v. American Humanist Association, which upheld the display of a cross in Maryland. The Supreme Court then ordered the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider its decision in light of American Legion. Yesterday, the Eleventh Circuit held that the Pensacola cross was constitutional under American Legion. Writing the opinion for the court, Trump appointee Judge Kevin Newsom said that the courts should look to history for guidance in determining whether displays with religious imagery are constitutional.  Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe said, “The Eleventh Circuit’s decision is a major step in the right direction towards restoring an original understanding of the Constitution and securing religious liberty. For decades, the Supreme Court’s precedents on these issues have been neither correct nor consistent. The Supreme Court’s decision in American Legion took a major step towards correcting the errors that have led to prohibiting the acknowledgment of God in the public square. The Eleventh Circuit did an excellent job of applying American Legion correctly to the Pensacola cross case.”  Matt Clark, the attorney for the Foundation who filed amicus briefs at two stages of this case, added, “If yesterday’s decision from the Eleventh Circuit had been in place back in 2002, then Judge Roy Moore probably would have won the lawsuit over his Ten Commandments display.” Clark added, “The fact that the Pensacola cross had stood undisturbed for nearly 75 years was a factor in the Eleventh Circuit’s decision, but we believe that the Eleventh Circuit ultimately held that displays with religious imagery have to be judged by history. As the Supreme Court explained in 2005 in Van Orden v. Perry, displaying the Ten Commandments is completely consistent with the history of this nation.”  Kayla Moore, the President of the Foundation, said, “We are grateful that the Eleventh Circuit took a significant step towards restoring an original understanding of the First Amendment, and we hope that they will continue moving in that direction.”  Judge Roy Moore, Founder and President Emeritus of the Foundation, said, “The Constitution was never meant to prohibit the public acknowledgement of God, either through a cross or a Ten Commandments display.” Judge Moore added, “The Founders believed that our rights could only be secure when the people were convicted that their rights were the gift of God. As the courts look more to history, I hope that they will discover that religious liberty ultimately is a gift from our Creator that cannot be taken away by man, today!”“Pensacola’s defense is supported primarily by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, but Roy Moore’s Foundation for Moral Law also supports the city’s position”",229,189,,40,,,,7,1253274441537451,/story.php?story_fbid=1253274441537451&id=209038435961062

As stated in Attorney Isaak’s motion, any individual would have a solid basis for questioning Judge John Rochester’s impartiality, political motivation, and bias in presiding over this case.         John Rochester’s friendship, support, and financial contribution to Doug Jones in combination with his wife’s open criticism of Judge Moore during the 2017 special election for US Senate in which Judge Moore was a candidate, mandates immediate recusal  of Judge John Rochester in this frivolous action.

It was so adorable I thought it appropriate for Valentines.  Happy Valentines Day! “My grandfather is Roy Moore.  He was born February 11, 1947. He was married in 1985 to Kayla Kisor who is my grandmother.  Roy Moore went to West Point in 1965 and graduated in 1969. He was in the army and fought in the Vietnam war. He was the captain and served as a military police officer. He returned to Alabama and became the first full-time prosecutor in Etowah County. He was appointed circuit judge in Etowah County and later served as chief justice of the United States Supreme Court. (Ok-not quite...Alabama Supreme Court). He is currently running for the Senate. He works at the Foundation for Moral Law in Montgomery. He has four children and five grandchildren, and I am one of them (lol-🤣yep).   He loves to travel. He spent time in Texas doing boxing, wrestling, and in Australia riding horses in the outback and learn their ways. For hobbies he loves to ride horses and write poetry and books. His books are called Help me God (😂 no!  So Help Me God!) and law of the land. He also likes doing work outside like right now he is building a house. He’s very thoughtful, friendly,  intelligent, and inventive and I love him. (Awe 🥰) He is amazing, I wish he wasn’t working because he never plays with me or my sister or my cousins. (Awe 😥) I’m so glad my grandmother Kayla Moore is there to help him because he always try’s to do things that can hurt him but she always stops him (not always but we won’t tell her -sh).

Judge Moore stated, “One of the most important issues affecting our Country is a lack of morality. The Ten Commandments represent the ‘Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God,’ upon which our Nation began in 1776. The Ten Commandments Monument will be returned to our state’s capital, only blocks from where it was removed in 2003, where it will stand as a continual memorial to the foundation of our laws. Today more than ever, we need to return to those laws and moral standards upon which our Country was founded. Our decline as a nation will not be at the hand of a foreign power or external enemy but will occur only when we lose that virtue and morality, under God, upon which we began.” Judge Moore added, “The Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God are not only the source of our morals but also our unalienable rights. We have the right to religious liberty because God said, ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me,’ and we have the right to life because God said, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ The Ten Commandments Monument should arrive in Montgomery the afternoon of Tuesday, February 11, between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. The public is invited to attend. A press conference will be available for credentialed media.",1K,810,,200,1,1,,95,1243077479223814,/story.php?story_fbid=1243077479223814&id=209038435961062

Foundation President Kayla Moore observed that ""Less than ten months from today, the American people will exercise their constitutional right to pass judgment upon the Presidency of Donald Trump by voting for him or against him in the November election.  Unfortunately, impeachment advocates want to deprive the American people of this constitutional right by undoing the results of the 2016 election and foreclosing the results of the 2020 election."" FOUNDATION URGES SENATE TO VOTE ""NO"" ON IMPEACHMENT  MONTGOMERY, AL:  The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama-based nonprofit corporation dedicated to the strict interpretation of the Constitution, today urged the United States Senate to vote “no” on the articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump.  Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe explained, ""Our reason is clear and simple:  the articles of impeachment simply do not satisfy the requirements for impeachment and removal under the Constitution.  Article II, Section 4 sets forth the grounds for impeachment and removal: 'treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'   The allegations contained in these articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress), even if true, do not constitute treason.  They do not constitute bribery.  They do not constitute high crimes.  They do not constitute misdemeanors.  The message of the articles is unmistakable: 'There are no constitutional grounds for impeachment, but impeach him anyway!'”  The Foundation claims the articles of impeachment constitute a partisan attempt to remove a President who has stood against the radical agenda of the Left wing of the Democratic Party.  Alexander Hamilton warned in Federalist No. 65 of the danger that impeachment proceedings  ...will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.  The Foundation observed that the first impeachment of a President, Andrew Johnson, was conducted in like manner by a radical Republican majority of the Congress.   His removal in the Senate was prevented by the vote of Senator Edmund Ross, a Kansas Republican who later explained that,  In a large sense the independence of the executive office as a coordinate branch of government was on trial.  If ... the President must step down ... a disgraced man ... upon insufficient proofs and from partisan consideration, the office of President would be degraded.  Judge Roy Moore, Founder and President Emeritus of the Foundation, stated, ""To legitimize this proceeding will seriously depreciate the Office of the President and effectively destroy the separation of powers essential to our constitutional form of government.""  Foundation President Kayla Moore observed that ""Less than ten months from today, the American people will exercise their constitutional right to pass judgment upon the Presidency of Donald Trump by voting for him or against him in the November election.  Unfortunately, impeachment advocates want to deprive the American people of this constitutional right by undoing the results of the 2016 election and foreclosing the results of the 2020 election.""",171,158,,12,,1,,11,1232438813621014,/story.php?story_fbid=1232438813621014&id=209038435961062

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2019-12-12 20:46:50,"The impeachment push by Congress is only more evidence that they will do anything and everything it takes to stop our President and the progress he has made for our Country. Now, it will go before the Senate where we will really see where Republicans stand on exonerating President Trump of these charges.  Alabama can go ahead and count on Doug Jones voting to impeach.  That’s why it was so important for them to win the Alabama Senate seat in 2017, but they did so only after unleashing the most vilifying and malicious campaigns this nation has ever seen.  One that hurt not only me but my family, and my supporters alike. I know we’re all worried about what they will do to me if I run again, but that’s where we must trust in God. I’m ready to charge back on these false allegations and massive disinformation campaigns but I need an army of conservative supporters to charge with me! They will do whatever it takes to stop President Trump, just like they will do whatever it takes to stop me from running for Senate again. This past weekend, I visited Muscle Shoals, AL for a breakfast at 8:30 a.m., where I was met with protesters.You can hear my speech here on Facebook-Stand With Judge Moore. It’s not me they protest but our God! My purpose has always been to recognize God and defend religious liberty at the highest level of government, and that’s what I have done. I’m not done standing for our Alabama values that we all believe and know to be true. The fight has merely begun!  And that’s exactly why I’m running for U.S. Senate, to have the opportunity to stand on the Senate floor and call the country back to the recognition of God. But they're going to pull out all the stops to try to stop my message.  We can't allow Washington insiders come into Alabama and control our elections, and cherry pick our Senator. The people of Alabama were not fooled by the Democrats million dollar smear campaign they unleashed against me in 2017, as shown by over half a million voters who came out to vote for me! If we stand together now, we can defeat the establishment and send a Senator to Washington who will advocate on behalf of the people of Alabama, who will vote for the best interest of Alabama, and who will acknowledge God the whole way! One thing is for sure, if we don’t stand now and charge back, we will truly be overcome with a corrupt government. Thank you in advance for your faithful support!

""The people of Alabama are proud of their State's history,"" she said, ""and they have a right to display monuments to respect and remember heroes of the past.  We'll never know where we are going if we don't remember where we've been.""FOUNDATION THANKFUL FOR ALABAMA SUPREME COURT MONUMENT DECISION MONTGOMERY, AL:  The Foundation for Moral Law, a Montgomery-based legal institute dedicated to the strict interpretation of the Constitution according to the intent of its Framers, expressed its thanks to the Alabama Supreme Court for a decision upholding the constitutionality of Alabama's Memorial Preservation Act. While in other states activist groups have pressured local governments to remove historic monuments that some found offensive, the Alabama Legislature passed a statute prohibiting the removal of such monuments.  Officials of the City of Birmingham  used plywood to cover up the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, and the State of Alabama asked the circuit court for a declaratory judgment directing Birmingham officials to remove the barriers.  The circuit court held that the Act is unconstitutional because it violates the City's right to free speech, forcing them to display a pro-Confederate message City officials do not want to display.  The State appealed, and the Foundation for Moral Law filed an amicus brief in support of the State and in support of the Monument Preservation Act. Writing for the Alabama Supreme Court, Justice Bryan held that the Act does not violate any free speech rights of the City of Birmingham and remanded the case to the circuit court to direct City officials to remove the barrier and impose a fine of $25,000 on the City for violating the Act. Foundation President Kayla Moore thanked the Court for recognizing the importance of historical monuments and refusing to cave in to pressure groups.  ""The people of Alabama are proud of their State's history,"" she said, ""and they have a right to display monuments to respect and remember heroes of the past.  We'll never know where we are going if we don't remember where we've been."" Montgomery Attorney Jay Hinton, who assisted with the drafting of the brief and filed it with the Alabama Supreme Court, noted that ""The Act protects all historic monuments, not just Confederate memorials.  The Alabama Supreme Court's decision shows good common sense."" Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe added, ""In a sense, historic monuments are voices of dissent.  They are a reminder to the politically correct orthodoxy that there was a time when people thought differently, and perhaps the voices of the past should be heard and considered today.  As George Orwell says in his novel 1984, 'Who controls the past controls the future.  Who controls the present controls the past.'  There is a drive to rewrite America's history to facilitate the creation of a very different kind of nation, and we must not allow that to happen.""

Stand with Judge Roy Moore,,2019-11-27 09:37:43,"THANKSGIVING:  A Time To Be Thankful For Our Freedoms Recently a visiting minister to our church posed a simple question: “What are you thankful for?”  As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, a tradition dating back to our Pilgrim fathers, I am considering that question and would like to share with you some of the things that I am grateful for. My family is a great blessing from God.  Kayla, my beautiful wife, has stood with me through the worst and best of times for nearly 35 years.  We have four children: a sweet daughter Heather who works as a bookkeeper and principal’s assistant in an elementary school, Roy who was recently promoted to Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Army, Caleb who will soon graduate from Troy University and works as my Chief Communications Officer in the U.S. Senate Campaign, and Micah who will graduate from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 2020.  I am proud of each of my children and the special abilities that God has given them.  I also have 5 charming granddaughters who amaze me with their Christian witness and personalities.  They are a delight.  But that isn’t my greatest reason to be thankful. And I am thankful for the people of Alabama.  As I run for the United States Senate I never cease to be amazed at the people of Alabama – old and young, rich and poor, male and female, black and white, Democrat and Republican – who continue to offer their support for my candidacy which inspires me to keep fighting.  But as much as that means to me personally I have an even greater reason for which to be thankful. After suffering through false accusations during my run for U.S. Senate in 2017, I came to understand what Jesus said in Matthew 5:11-12, “Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.  Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven…”  My family was deeply affected by the lies, but we have learned that the greatest blessing is suffering for the cause of Christ.       My greatest reason to be thankful is the gift of God’s Son and the freedom we have to fight for our Country, our Constitution and morality, with nothing to fear and nothing to lose.  The very soul of our County is at stake as an immoral, socialist agenda wants to take from us our God-given rights and freedoms.  We must continue to stand for the truth. In the words of Martin Luther: “Here I stand, I can do no other, So Help Me God.” Sincerely,  P.S.

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2019-11-22 09:23:07,"One of my closest friends at West Point was Jon Shine, a fellow member of the Army gymnastics team. After graduation Jon married his high school sweetheart, Gail, and like me found himself in Vietnam where he was a great leader who exemplified the West Point motto of Duty, Honor, Country. On one of his last missions he was mortally wounded and died on October 5, 1970, approximately 18 months after graduation. I was told that his last words to his Sergeant were, “take care of my men” according to a book written about his life. Prior to his death he wrote his beloved Gail to explain why he went to Vietnam. “We both know that my going is a matter of duty to our Country.” Jon was a devout Christian and man of God, with a strong sense of “duty”. As I celebrated Veterans Day last week I thought of Jon, and other classmates killed in that terrible conflict and I wondered what they would  have thought if they had known how much our Country would change in just 50 years. In the late 60’s and early 70’s America was much different, families were much more stable, and our borders were secure. We didn’t have same-sex marriage and sodomy as well as abortion was against the law in nearly every state. Mass murders and shootings in schools and other public places were simply nonexistent , and the Ten Commandments were legally displayed in many schools and courthouses. Our children were not taught “gender identity” or bisexuality, and socialism was not a topic of discussion in the U.S. Congress. The Vietnam war was protested but nobody took a “knee“ in disrespect of our National Anthem, nobody! I don’t know what my deceased comrades would say, but I do know what they would do. They would have continued to obey their oath to fight all enemies “foreign and domestic”, and so must I. Some have asked concerning my decision to again seek the office of the U.S. Senate, why would I subject myself again to false accusations and major disinformation campaigns by a Washington Establishment which  has vowed to resist me by all means and which does not want to hear the truth about the reality of God and the relevance of our Constitution. As Jon said, it is a matter of duty to our Country. As you know, last week I filed a major lawsuit against the two largest Democratic PAC’s in our Country, SMP (Senate majority PAC), indeed a misnomer, and Priorities USA, which spent over $6 million against me to slander my good name and reputation and disseminate disinformation in the last four weeks of the 2017 special election to steal the vote from the people of Alabama. These are the same PAC’s which spent over $300 million for Hillary Clinton in 2016, thankfully they lost! This suit will have national implications.   I need your help on my campaign! The words of Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address are a fitting tribute to my fellow comrades in Vietnam, as well words to inspire our actions today, “It is for us, the living, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us. That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave their last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”   Again I thank you and may God be with you.

Individuals named in the complaint are Guy Cecil, Chairman of Priorities USA, Priorities USA Super PAC, Bully Pulpit International, and Waterfront Strategies. These are the “secret” Super PAC’s that ran intimidating ad’s that were used on social media falsely stating that voting records would be made public knowledge and would be used against individuals voting for Judge Moore. Priorities USA, the super PAC backing Doug Jones in 2017, spent in excess of $190 million to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016. Senate Majority PAC, another defendant, spent over $90 million in the same effort. Both PACs, allied with the Democratic Party, provided the vast majority of funding for Highway 31, the PAC that defamed Judge Moore in the 2017 election.  Bully Pulpit International, one of the largest progressive digital ad agencies in the Country, was used by the Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns and numerous Democratic House, Senate, and gubernatorial campaigns.

At a CNN town hall Thursday night, when asked whether ""religious institutions like colleges, churches and charities should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage,"" O'Rourke responded, ""Yes, There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.""  According to the LGBTQ plan on his website, he will quickly enforce this policy by executive action.   Foundation President Kayla Moore said, “For years, liberals have pledged not to target churches for disagreeing with same-sex marriage. We never believed them. O’Rourke is confirming what we thought all along: liberals will never be content until they silence opposition to homosexuality.”   Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe noted that the question was not about churches that refuse to perform same-sex marriages but about churches that ""oppose same-sex marriage.""  He added, ""O'Rourke also wants to revoke the tax exemption of the National Rifle Association.  The Constitution frowns on content-based discrimination and forbids viewpoint-based discrimination.

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Moral Law Issues",Moral Law Issues,2019-10-11 15:52:44,"FOUNDATION DEFENDS CHRISTIAN FLORIST WHOSE CASE RETURNS TO U.S. SUPREME COURT MONTGOMERY, AL:  The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama nonprofit organization dedicated to the defense of religious liberty, filed an amicus brief on Friday at the U.S. Supreme Court in support Barronelle Stutzman, whose case may finally decide whether Christians must cater to same-sex weddings over their religious objections. Stutzman is the owner of Arlene’s Flowers, a small business in Washington State. For years, Stutzman had served Curt Freed and Robert Ingersoll, who were homosexuals. Stutzman had served them for years when they requested flowers for other events. But when the two men sought to marry, they asked Stutzman to cater to their wedding. Stutzman politely explained that she could not create a custom floral arrangement for that occasion, because as a Christian she believed marriage was between one man and one woman. The Washington Supreme Court eventually held that she violated the state’s anti-discrimination laws. Stutzman asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take her case. Around that time, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which held that the government violated the Free Exercise Clause when it showed open hostility and disrespect to a Christian baker who did not want to cater to a same-sex wedding. The U.S. Supreme Court then ordered the Washington Supreme Court to reconsider Stutzman’s case under Masterpiece Cakeshop. The Washington Supreme Court concluded that the State did not show such hostility to Stutzman, and she again asked the Court to take her case. The Foundation filed an amicus brief supporting her. Foundation Counsel Matt Clark explained, “Under Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Free Exercise Clause protects a religious person only if the government was disrespectful or treated her worse than others. But now since Justice Kavanaugh has replaced Justice Kennedy, who authored Masterpiece Cakeshop, Stutzman’s case gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to answer the question that Masterpiece Cakeshop did not: does the Free Exercise Clause protect you even if the government is not ‘mean?’ We invited them to answer this question, and we argued thoroughly that the answer is yes.” Foundation President Kayla Moore said, “Religious freedom is an unalienable right given not by man but by God. The Free Exercise Clause should clearly protect Stutzman, and every other Christian, who objects on religious grounds to endorsing an activity that goes against God’s design for marriage.” Morallaw.org",62,55,,7,,,,4,1136869629844600,/story.php?story_fbid=1136869629844600&id=209038435961062

In a case that caught national attention, former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyer was convicted of murdering Botham Jean in his own apartment. At the sentencing phase, Jean’s brother showed a remarkable display of compassion and forgiveness by pointing Guyer to Jesus and giving her a hug. Appearing to follow his example, Judge Kemp came down from the bench at the end of the sentencing, gave Guyer her personal Bible, shared the Gospel, and gave her a hug. Yesterday, the FFRF sent a letter to the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct, claiming that Judge Kemp violated the Establishment Clause and demanding an ethics investigation. Today, the Foundation for Moral Law sent a response to the Commission, discussing how the FFRF’s claims are based on outdated precedents and that Judge Kemp’s noncoercive way of encouraging Guyer to find redemption in Christ did not violate the Constitution. Foundation President Kayla Moore said, “Judge Kemp displayed a much-needed touch of compassion at the end of a very difficult trial by encouraging Guyer to find redemption in the same place where many Americans look: Jesus Christ. Judge Kemp deserves to be commended, not condemned, for her actions.” Foundation Counsel Matt Clark added, “The United States Supreme Court has been moving away from the obsolete precedents that the FFRF is using to call for Judge Kemp’s punishment. In cases like this, the Court no longer asks whether the government is “endorsing” religion, but instead focuses on whether the practice comports with this nation’s history. The Framers of the First Amendment not only permitted but encouraged the noncoercive encouragement of Christianity. They would be proud of Judge Kemp if they saw what she did.”",515,358,5,70,11,47,24,111,1131312480400315,/story.php?story_fbid=1131312480400315&id=209038435961062

We commend Sheriff Moon for doing the same as he seeks the welfare of his county.”  Foundation Counsel Matt Clark added, “We believe that the most recent Supreme Court decisions would protect Sheriff Moon even if he did lead the event in his capacity as sheriff, but we are pleased that he did not cave to the FFRF’s demand to cancel the vigil altogether. The FFRF’s claims are based on older precedents that have been significantly weakened in recent years. In the unlikely event that the FFRF actually takes action, the Foundation would be pleased to offer its assistance to the Sheriff’s Department. morallaw.org",37,31,1,5,,,,4,1129850247213205,/story.php?story_fbid=1129850247213205&id=209038435961062

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2019-09-28 11:02:09,"FOUNDATION SUPPORTS PRAYER OF TENNESSEE COACH  MONTGOMERY, AL:  The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama nonprofit organization dedicated to the defense of religious liberty, defended the prayer of a Tennessee high school coach at a football game as a legitimate expression of free speech and free exercise of religion.  In a letter to the Rutherford County (TN) Schools, the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) complained that Rockvale High School football coach Rick Rice’s prayer violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The matter was apparently resolved by having students lead in prayer before subsequent games.  But even though the School District has said religious activities must be student-initiated and student-led, language apparently borrowed from the federal Equal Access Act, the Foundation for Moral Law says the Equal Access Act is only a minimum threshold schools must meet in respect the rights of religious students.  The First Amendment gives students and teachers more rights that those mentioned in the Equal Access Act.  In a letter to the Rutherford County Schools and to Coach Rice, the Foundation offered its assistance in the unlikely event litigation takes place, and also attached a detailed memorandum the Foundation had previously sent to Alabama schools on religious activity at school athletic events.  Foundation President Kayla Moore commended Coach Rice for praying for his players’ success and safety, saying “The courts have repeatedly said that neither students nor teachers shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door.”  Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe added, “Nothing in the Constitution requires that schools be religion-free zones or that religion is a censored topic that has no place in the public arena. Furthermore, the protection for religious expression in Tennessee’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act goes even beyond that of the United States Constitution.

Devout Christians Carl and Angel Larsen founded Telescope Media Group to film weddings and produce video albums telling the story of each wedding from a Christian perspective. Because of their religious convictions, they decline to produce albums of same-sex weddings. “Angel and I serve everyone,” Carl said, “We just can’t produce films promoting every message.” The Minnesota Department of Human Rights concluded that Telescope’s refusal constituted discrimination against homosexuals, and the federal district court agreed. The Larsens appealed to the Eighth Circuit, and the Foundation filed an amicus brief arguing that Minnesota violated the Larsens rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of speech, because the production of a wedding video is a work of art that expresses a message protected by the First Amendment.  Last Friday the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that “the First Amendment allows the Larsens to choose when to speak and what to say.” It is uncertain whether the State of Minnesota will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Foundation President Kayla Moore thanked the court for upholding religious liberty: “Jefferson’s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom declared, ‘To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.’ Jefferson would be even more shocked that Minnesota wants to force the Larsens to actually produce films promoting what they disbelieve and abhor. Thankfully, the Eighth Circuit has taken a firm stand against that kind of tyranny.”  ",45,37,,8,,,,8,1103239713207592,/story.php?story_fbid=1103239713207592&id=209038435961062

Stand with Judge Roy Moore,,2019-06-25 09:41:42,"Every poll the liberal mainstream media put out in 2016 told us Hillary Clinton was our next president.  One poll out of Princeton University said Donald Trump was 99% certain to lose to Hillary.  Despite all the media's wishful thinking, Donald Trump is our president. Now they're doing the same thing to me here in Alabama.  Just like we knew they would, they're trotting out the same old tired lines. They're repeating debunked allegations.  Democrats and Republicans alike are claiming that the 2017 election was a valid election, despite the widely reported disinformation campaign perpetrated on the people of Alabama by both Republicans AND Democrats.  Democrat Doug Jones himself even said he was outraged by Democrat meddling in the campaign.  Just like they didn't want Donald Trump to go to D.C. to drain the swamp, they don't want me in the United States Senate because they know I won't cave to the culture of cronyism there.  They don't want our values in Washington, D.C. They are so desperate to keep your closely held beliefs out of D.C. they'll engage in all manner of dishonesty.  And they'll spend millions spreading those lies.  As you may remember, Mitch McConnell and his cronies spent more than $30 MILLION viciously attacking me and my family in a desperate effort to defeat me during the Republican Primary. Then, the Democrats spent another $20 million in the matter of about two months spreading the worst lies about a man they could possibly spread.  But I'm still standing.  I'm right here where I've always been, fighting for our shared values.  And I'm going to need your help to keep fighting.  If you've had enough of the D.C. Smear Machine's lies, I'm counting on you to chip in a donation to help me deliver a knock-out blow to McConnell and his cronies. I'm running again to take our values to D.C. to help put God back in his rightful place in government.   And the same old swampy characters in D.C. are working overtime to keep our values out of the capitol.  Will you help us show the D.C. elites that you and I won't give up in our effort to Drain the Swamp and take our country back for our shared values? We're only just getting started. I'd be honored if you'll stand with us in this fight.   Thank you for your continued support in this battle. My family and I couldn't continue this fight without you.

Stand with Judge Roy Moore,,2019-06-24 10:50:21,"Letter from Judge Moore and video from campaign: When I launched my campaign last week, I reaffirmed the driving force behind our efforts these last few decades in Alabama.  I said it Thursday, and I'll say it again every chance I get: Our right to recognize God in our daily lives remains inviolate, no matter what any court says. If we don’t recognize God in our lives and in our government, we lose our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I hope the Supreme Court ultimately hears this. Religion was defined specifically by our founding fathers. We have forgotten that, and when we forget it, we forget the whole basis of the United States Constitution. Our government is out of control -- it cannot control itself, and it creeps into our lives taking away our basic liberties -- the right of a child to be born. These are rights given by God, not by man. They can not be taken away. I have entered this race to try to set that straight.  But our opponents are many, and they are determined to keep our message out of Washington. Interestingly, both Doug Jones and Mitch McConnell are lining up, shoulder to shoulder to try to keep our Christian values out of the U.S. Senate.  And D.C.'s loudest advocate for illegal immigration and amnesty in America -- the powerful Chamber of Commerce -- has been lining up behind my opponents for months.  Even a few supposedly conservative Republicans inside the Beltway have decided to line up against me.  Despite all that, our message stays the same.  I hope you'll join us as we work to return God's truth to Washington, D.C.  >>> One baby aborted is one baby too many.  >>>There are only two genders.  >>> The two parent nuclear family is the best building block for a rightly ordered, just society.  >> Religious liberty and the proper role of God in government is non-negotiable if we aim to protect the rest of our God-given rights.

Stand with Judge Roy Moore,,2019-06-21 17:54:46,"Yesterday I announced my candidacy for the United States Senate to defeat Democrat Doug Jones. Predictably, the Establishment are on the attack. They hate the fact that I live by my principles, and that I'll vote that way too. They know I won't sell out to the swamp serpents once safely in office as many of them did when they got to D.C. I'm running for one reason: to return the acknowledgement of God and a respect for the U.S. Constitution to Congress. That's why Mitch McConnell and the entire establishment HATE me and it’s exactly why they colluded with Liberal Democrat Doug Jones in 2017. They're frightened at the thought of a U.S. Senator who is unashamed of our values and unashamed of our deeply-held beliefs as conservatives and as Christians. One thing scares them most: Despite all their attacks I’m still standing. So please, stand with me to fight back against the forces of evil colluding to keep conservatives out of Washington. I took an Oath on the banks of the Hudson River as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies -- domestic and foreign. I fought in a war to defend our Constitutional Republic. I fought in the courts for over 15 years against activist liberal judges that have usurped their authority over the Constitution. I refuse to let Mitch McConnell and the D.C. Elites force us conservatives out of government. I have a duty to God-fearing Americans to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our values. If elected to the U.S. Senate -- I'll fight for YOU in Washington. I'm not running for the U.S. Senate to join the ""good ole boys network"" or gain favor with McConnell and his cronies. Instead, I'm running for U.S. Senate to root out the evil destroying our nation. I'm running for U.S. Senate to take a stand for God, morality, the Constitution and our traditional values. I'm running to be YOUR voice -- not a voice for McConnell or the Washington elite. But just like last time, Mitch and the rest of the swamp will pull out all the stops to keep our values out of Congress. I can't defeat McConnell and his cronies without your immediate support. So can I count on you to let me know you're with me by chipping in a generous contribution of $2,700, $2,000, $1,500, $1,000, $500, $250, $100, $75, $50 or $35 immediately. Of course, I understand only a few people are able to afford $2,800 ($5,600 per couple) -- the maximum legal amount under federal law. If you are such a person, this is a race worth investing the maximum amount. This is our opportunity to effectively FIRE Mitch McConnell by hiring a firebrand conservative willing to Drain the Swamp. A victory over McConnell and the D.C. elites will embolden conservative patriots across the country to rise up, challenge the RINO's and elect a constitutional majority in Congress to support President Trump in 2020. That's why I'm asking you to please chip in the maximum amount you can donate at this critical moment.   For some, I know $50, $35 or $25 is a stretch -- and for others $5 or $10 can be a major sacrifice for others. I'm not sure how much you can give right now. But whatever the amount, please know your contribution is greatly appreciated and will be put to immediate use for my campaign. I'm counting on you like never before. So please, chip in a donation to help me stand and fight the forces of evil and deliver a knock-out blow to McConnell and his cronies. I pledge the maximum amount to help fight back!

June is Pride Month. It’s when the LGBTQ+ community stands together to show the world that we are united and that we’re proud of who we are. Pride month symbolizes our commitment to living our truth. It’s an empowering month, but it also reminds us of the many hurdles still in front of us. We all have to make our voices heard, and that starts at the ballot box. If you aren’t registered to vote, you can’t make your voice heard. If you live in Alabama, click here to register to vote. REGISTER TO VOTE In many states, including Alabama, the LGBTQ+ community can be denied employment or housing because of who they are. We are discriminated against in the adoption process. Some of us are even banned from the military, and veterans in our community can be refused healthcare. With the Obergefell decision in 2015, the Supreme Court recognized marriage equality to all couples. After that victory, then-Chief Justice Roy Moore ordered probate judges in Alabama to ignore Federal law. Now our Legislature has voted to end state-issued marriage licenses to anyone. We’re all in this together. Working for equal rights requires standing up each and every day. We all know how easy it is to slip backward, and we’ve come too far to let that happen. We need leaders who will stand up for us by fighting bad policy and supporting good bills like the Equality Act. That’s why I’m asking you to register to vote. Use your voice and exercise your right to make sure we all have the representation we deserve at every level of government. We won’t live in fear, and we won’t be shamed, not by anyone. I’m proud of the strength and resilience of our community and of the progress we’ve made. Please register, check your registration, or pass this message on to someone who hasn’t registered yet.

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Moral Law Issues",Moral Law Issues,2019-06-05 12:37:03,"June 5, 2019 FOUNDATION: AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL  MONTGOMERY :  The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama nonprofit corporation dedicated to the strict interpretation of the Constitution as intended by its Framers, filed an amicus brief with the Fifth  Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals  Thursday arguing that the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or “Obamacare”) is unconstitutional.   In NFIB v. Sebelius in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the ACA was a tax because of its individual health care mandate and penalty and was therefore authorized by the Taxing and Spending Clause of Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. But President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the individual mandate and penalty. In December 2018 a Federal District Court Judge in Texas ruled that because the individual mandate and penalty had been repealed, the ACA was no longer a tax and is therefore unconstitutional. The case has been appealed to the Fifth Circuit.   Foundation President Kayla Moore stated the Foundation’s position: “The Constitution delegates only certain powers to the federal government and reserves all others to the states or to the people. Nothing in the Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate or finance health care; health care is the responsibility of individuals, families, and churches.”   Foundation Senior Counsel John Eidsmoe added: “Either the ACA is a tax or it isn’t. If it is, it was not properly adopted because it originated in the Senate, and Article I, § 7 says all revenue bills must originate in the House.  If it is not a tax, it has no authorization under the Taxing and Spending Clause or any other portion of the Constitution.”   The Fifth Circuit is expected to decide the case later this year, after which it will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court.

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2019-06-03 10:20:25,"“In the past several days, much controversy has surrounded Judge Roy Moore’s Twitter account (@RealJudgeMoore).  On Tuesday, Judge Moore responded to a comment from another candidate , Bradley Byrne, who has officially announced for U.S. Senate in Alabama. In response, a firestorm of liberal activist, and Twitter trolls flooded Judge Moore’s feed with vile comments. Despite the fact Judge Moore has yet to announce any plans to run for public office, the attitude of the Washington establishment and liberal left is exemplary of how hard they will try to keep our conservative values from reaching the halls of the U.S. Senate. A recent politico article stated, ""Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he has ""NOTHING"" against Moore, That came after Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted at Moore to steer clear of the race."" In 2017, Republicans and Democrats alike conspired to defeat Judge Moore in the U.S. Senate special election. Groups spent upwards of $50 million dollars to spread falsehoods and deceit among Alabama voters. In Washington, they will try to use the same smear tactics and uglydisinformation campaigns to steal the vote from the people of Alabama, if Judge Moore were to declare. However, in Alabama, where this highly important election is to be held, Judge Moore is leading polls among candidates who have already declared their candidacy. As to the accusers, every single one has been unequivocally discredited, and 18 months since the allegations were made not one of Judge Moore's accusers has appeared in court to tell their story. Judge Moore is the victim of this defamation, yet he is the only one who has given his deposition, and has voluntarily taken a lie detector test, which he passed. You see, the problem is that it is not Judge Moore they don’t want in Washington D.C. it is for the values for which he stands. They are afraid of him because he won't back down.  The liberal establishment intends to draw a divide between President Trump and Judge Moore because just like they did not want President Trump, they do not want a man who has time and time again refused to bow to the tyrannical giant of government in this country. Judge Moore does not represent the government, he represents you! BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP! The powerful political forces in Washington D.C. who are using the media to manipulate voters and control our elections WILL NOT STOP! The question is, is Alabama going to fall for it again?

"Stand with Judge Roy Moore,Kayla Moore",Kayla Moore,2019-08-26 15:44:24,"ALABAMA FOUNDATION DEFENDS MINNESOTA PRODUCER  MONTGOMERY: The Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama non-profit corporation dedicated to the defense of religious liberty, the traditional family, and the strict interpretation of the Constitution as intended by its Framers, applauded a ruling by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the right of Telescope Media Group, a Minnesota Christian company that produces wedding videos, to refuse to film same-sex weddings that violate the company’s religious beliefs.  Devout Christians Carl and Angel Larsen founded Telescope Media Group to film weddings and produce video albums telling the story of each wedding from a Christian perspective. Because of their religious convictions, they decline to produce albums of same-sex weddings. “Angel and I serve everyone,” Carl said, “We just can’t produce films promoting every message.” The Minnesota Department of Human Rights concluded that Telescope’s refusal constituted discrimination against homosexuals, and the federal district court agreed. The Larsens appealed to the Eighth Circuit, and the Foundation filed an amicus brief arguing that Minnesota violated the Larsens rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of speech, because the production of a wedding video is a work of art that expresses a message protected by the First Amendment.  Last Friday the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that “the First Amendment allows the Larsens to choose when to speak and what to say.” It is uncertain whether the State of Minnesota will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Foundation President Kayla Moore thanked the court for upholding religious liberty: “Jefferson’s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom declared, ‘To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.’ Jefferson would be even more shocked that Minnesota wants to force the Larsens to actually produce films promoting what they disbelieve and abhor. Thankfully, the Eighth Circuit has taken a firm stand against that kind of tyranny.”  ",45,37,,8,,,,8,1103239713207592,/story.php?story_fbid=1103239713207592&id=209038435961062

It's sad, but true. They HATE the fact that – despite their disgusting and vile attacks against me and my family – I refuse to sit down, shut up, and surrender to the establishment. Instead, I’m rolling up my sleeves and running for U.S. Senate against the elites with every ounce of energy in my body.

Stand with Judge Roy Moore,,2019-06-24 10:50:21,"Letter from Judge Moore and video from campaign: When I launched my campaign last week, I reaffirmed the driving force behind our efforts these last few decades in Alabama.  I said it Thursday, and I'll say it again every chance I get: Our right to recognize God in our daily lives remains inviolate, no matter what any court says. If we don’t recognize God in our lives and in our government, we lose our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I hope the Supreme Court ultimately hears this. Religion was defined specifically by our founding fathers. We have forgotten that, and when we forget it, we forget the whole basis of the United States Constitution. Our government is out of control -- it cannot control itself, and it creeps into our lives taking away our basic liberties -- the right of a child to be born. These are rights given by God, not by man. They can not be taken away. I have entered this race to try to set that straight.  But our opponents are many, and they are determined to keep our message out of Washington. Interestingly, both Doug Jones and Mitch McConnell are lining up, shoulder to shoulder to try to keep our Christian values out of the U.S. Senate.  And D.C.'s loudest advocate for illegal immigration and amnesty in America -- the powerful Chamber of Commerce -- has been lining up behind my opponents for months.  Even a few supposedly conservative Republicans inside the Beltway have decided to line up against me.  Despite all that, our message stays the same.  I hope you'll join us as we work to return God's truth to Washington, D.C.  >>> One baby aborted is one baby too many.  >>>There are only two genders.  >>> The two parent nuclear family is the best building block for a rightly ordered, just society.  >> Religious liberty and the proper role of God in government is non-negotiable if we aim to protect the rest of our God-given rights.

Or will you listen to the people of Alabama who are taxed enough already? Don't forget that you serve the people. Don't become that which you ran to change.  Call your legislator. This is NOT a done deal. Together, we can stop this massive gas-tax increase.  #StopTheGasTax #ReTaxAlabamaAct #VoteYourDistrict #ALpolitics",292,147,,4,15,4,122,141,992904057574492,/story.php?story_fbid=992904057574492&id=209038435961062

Stand with Judge Roy Moore,,2019-02-08 13:43:09,"IMMEDIATE RELEASE  “Where is Leigh Corfman?”  The case of Corfman v Moore in Montgomery county has been pending for over a year and Leigh Corfman has yet to appear before a court reporter to give her testimony under oath. On the other hand, Judge Roy Moore appeared for an entire day to give sworn testimony under extensive examination by Corfman‘s attorneys while Corfman has successfully avoided numerous motions to compel her testimony  Corfman’s attorneys from New York, San Francisco, Washington DC and Birmingham who represent Corfman  pro bono (for free) now refuse to allow their client to be examined under oath until Judge Moore answers specific questions regarding his home, car, and property in 1979. Shortly after Corfman‘s story was printed by the Washington Post she appeared on several national television and media outlets.  Before her appearances Corfman was “coached “for 6 to 8 hours by her present attorney from New York on how to respond to the media. But now in court documents she cannot recall whether or not Judge Moore lived in a mobile home or a house in 1979, whether he had a carport or a garage, or any specifics concerning his property. Judge Moore has refused to give Corfman facts which she will use to substantiate her false and malicious claims. Every person has an absolute right to defend his or her character and reputation from false and slanderous attacks. In a strange twist of logic Judge Moore has now been sued for defamation for simply denying Corfman’s false and malicious accusations Judge Moore by and through his attorney, Mrs. Melissa Isaak, has now filed a Motion to Dismiss Corfman’s  frivolous lawsuit, for simply denying her false claims. Not only does Judge Moore have a right to deny Corfman’s  claims, he also has a right to confront her in court. Where is Leigh Corfman?
