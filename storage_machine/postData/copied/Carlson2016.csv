Democrat Steve Carlson for U.S. Senator in 2020,,2019-08-14 09:07:33,"On August 12, 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals wrongfully issued a flawed determination that women who are understood to be eligible for and are receiving breast cancer treatment under the Medical Assistance Breast and Cervical Cancer treatment program, a federal program, can be removed before their treatment is completed. But look what the Minnesota DHS advertises on its website: ""This program covers all costs for medical treatment for as long as you might need treatment."" And both federal and state law require this as well. Obviously, this is going to be overturned. Please inform yourself and support the hundreds of Minnesota women, at least, that this is  being done to. At great risk!!",,,,,,,,,1060268837502097,/story.php?story_fbid=1060268837502097&id=252016764993979
Democrat Steve Carlson for U.S. Senator in 2020,,2019-06-21 11:10:48,"LEGISLATIVE ACTION NEEDED, AND FEDERAL, ON THE FAILURE TO AVOID PREVENTABLE DEATHS IN MINNESOTA DUE TO LACK OF INSULIN  Following up on my ongoing health care campaign, I recently engaged former Minnesota Independence Party gubernatorial nominee Tom Horner and Legislator Matt Dean regarding the FAILURE of the Star Tribune to accurately cover the critical issue of health disparities in the field of diabetes. I think it's an important issue for Election2020: ""Steve Carlson Tom Horner, your argument that ""a news story covering a candidateâ€™s statement focuses on what the candidate says"" is VERY deceiving and in the end fraudulent. You imagine a news editor such as myself would create ""a news story"" covering only ""a candidate's statement"" and so very 'logically' focuses only on that candidate statement. That is so ridiculous I can't imagine any actual media enterprise would conceive of it.  ""Going back to the very real issue of availability of insulin and the need for the government to stop preventable deaths, we don't care about politicians' statements on this issue. We do indeed care about first, that many low-income persons are exposed to risk of death because they can't afford their insuling. This is why we have medical assistance in the first place, this risk of catastrophic health incidents, but there's nothing in the government that is sufficiently targeted to have this affect. This is not a matter of opinion Tom and Matt Dean. It's what's called a value, or even a human value. Political leadership comes in at recognizing this situation and then determining whether there is some role government can play by protecting the general welfare as our Constitution provides. I believe Matt is pointing to the failure of the Star Tribune just to maintain this basic information function of transparently showing Minnesotans concerned about life how the Legislature is responding--or not. Not in assigning blame between the parties for blame's sake And I think he is right.""",,,,,,,,,1026144844247830,/story.php?story_fbid=1026144844247830&id=252016764993979
