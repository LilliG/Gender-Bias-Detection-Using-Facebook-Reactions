David Perdue,,2019-10-31 14:03:36,"Today, the U.S. Senate passed a funding package that only deals with about 15% of the federal government’s discretionary budget. That may be a step in the right direction, but there is still no clear path forward for funding our country’s defense priorities.  Washington is heading towards yet another colossal failure when the current short-term “continuing resolution” runs out on November 21. We wouldn’t even be in this position if Democrats had not broken a bipartisan agreement to fund the government on time without “poison pill” amendments. Their unending refusal to negotiate in good faith is leading Congress towards a 188th “continuing resolution,” which would be totally draconian for our military.”  Career politicians are going to pat themselves on the pack for getting a small part of the job done.

David Perdue,,2019-02-06 09:58:37,"What we saw last night was a contrast between an economic agenda that's working and a false narrative. We have the highest median household income in our history, the lowest African-American unemployment ever recorded, and the lowest overall unemployment in 50 years. The economy is rocking because of policies that have been put in place over the last two years.

David Perdue,,2019-01-25 15:22:39,"President Trump just announced a bipartisan solution to reopen the government while border security negotiations continue. We still have a crisis at our southern border, and President Trump is exactly right to address it. I applaud the President for continuing his efforts to enter into good faith negotiations with Democrats in the House and Senate.  Many Democrats have previously supported border security. Unfortunately, throughout this process they’ve clearly demonstrated they want to keep immigration a political issue instead of finding a real solution. If Democrats refuse to come to the negotiating table to tackle this national priority over the next three weeks, President Trump will do what is necessary to protect America.  Ultimately, this situation underscores the total dysfunction of Washington’s funding process. These conversations should have been completed last year, not four months into this fiscal year.",373,317,20,7,1,10,18,121,1155093167991479,/story.php?story_fbid=1155093167991479&id=159597424207730

He changed America forever.  Our country has overcome a lot, but there is much yet to be done. We need to reflect on the ideals of Dr. Martin Luther King – the things he fought for, the things he died for. He often reminded us that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. Though we may talk differently, look differently, or have different political views, he would remind us we are one nation under God. #MLKDay",179,168,,8,,,3,28,1152243494943113,/story.php?story_fbid=1152243494943113&id=159597424207730
