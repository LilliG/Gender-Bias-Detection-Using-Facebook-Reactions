Jessica Scarane,,2020-03-07 17:40:16,"In the late 80s, my dad decided he wanted to work for himself, so he quit his job and started his own business installing alarm systems. Shortly after that my mom got pregnant with my sister, but when my dad gave up working for a boss he also gave up my family’s health insurance.  When my mom went to her doctor to figure out how much having a baby without insurance would cost, she was told she’d need to pay $5,000 just for the doctor’s services. Oh, and because she didn’t have insurance, they’d require that payment in full by the fourth month of her pregnancy. When my mom balked at paying so early, she was dismissed and told she could just go to the free clinic if she couldn’t afford it. When my mom tells this story, even after all this time, you can hear how hurt she was in that moment. This is what a for-profit healthcare system continues to do today — value people based on their ability to pay. The last thing a pregnant person should be doing is stressing about the costs of birth. We absolutely don’t have to live this way. And with Medicare for All, we won’t.",14,12,0,1,0,1,0,1,195865971824872,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=195865971824872&id=108506830560787

Jessica Scarane,,2020-02-29 09:03:21,"We recently canvassed a woman who didn't know where to vote because her normal polling place was Pulaski Elementary, which closed last year. We checked on the Department of Elections website and her polling place was still listed as Pulaski. We called the Department of Elections 3 times: got hung up on once, transferred to the Dover campaign finance department, then finally got through to someone on the third try. They said that her new polling place would either be Richardson Park or Claymore Senior Center...but they hadn't finalized it yet.  The school has been closed for almost a year. The presidential primary election is in 8 weeks.  I'm furious. There are people looking up where to vote who are getting the wrong polling place and won't know where to vote on election day. We asked them to put something on the website to let people know, but they said they probably wouldn't do that; they will just send people new polling cards when they finally decide where their new polling places are. And when people DO learn where they can vote, there are still concerns about how they will get to their new polling place. I talked to another woman in Browntown this weekend who told us her husband got his new polling place card that said they'll vote at Richardson Park, but she was really concerned about people — especially the elderly or those who don't drive — being able to get there. This is voter suppression at work. **UPDATE ** We followed up with this voter and she received her new voter card in the mail yesterday. The Department of Elections website has been updated with the correct polling location.

Jessica Scarane,,2020-02-28 08:29:01,"This is Wilmington in 1968. Delaware’s governor deployed thousands of National Guard members to Wilmington to stifle protests after Dr. King's assassination, resulting in the longest peacetime occupation of an American city. The mostly white National Guard force kept the city under strict surveillance for 9 months, forcing businesses to close, trapping residents in their homes, and resulting in the murder of Douglas Henry Jr., who was shot to death even as he was complying with the guardsman’s orders. After the occupation ended, residents whose homes and businesses were damaged or closed never received compensation for their losses. Residents with lasting trauma from being violently surveilled never received the care they deserved. #BlackHistoryMonth is about more than remembering our history of anti-Black racism, it's about repairing the harm we've done and taking action to dismantle the systemic oppression that persists today. This is why I support reparations: just because a racist occupation or law no longer exists, the damage is already done. We can’t begin to repair these wrongs until we fairly compensate those who suffered under them. 📸: The News Journal",37,28,0,0,1,8,0,4,198263888251747,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=198263888251747&id=108506830560787

Jessica Scarane,,2020-01-19 13:03:58,"I talked to a voter who had previously struggled with opioid addiction after he broke his hand playing basketball. His doctor prescribed him Percocets. But, after his scrip ran out, he found that he was still suffering unbearable pain, so much so that it was affecting his ability to perform at his job. He couldn't get a doctor to write him another prescription, so in order to manage both the pain and keep his job, he resorted to buying opiates on the streets. The desperation to maintain his job, especially as his family's sole wage earner, and keep providing for his children, drove him further and further into dependency.  The worst part, he said, was the stigma he faced when he sought recovery. ""When a doctor prescribes you opioids, it's fine. But once you get it elsewhere, you're a drug addict."" I've heard so many similar stories from people who are in the midst of recovery. They are injured on the job or via sports or through a car accident, are given strong opioid prescriptions to manage the pain, and then left hanging when those scrips run out. They keep their addiction hidden because of the shame, often leading to a downward spiral. And when they finally muster the courage to seek help, they face negative stigma and expensive treatment programs. When we talk about the opioid crisis, we need to remember that that crisis lives in our own communities, and the devastation addiction wrecks on individual's lives. Pushing people to seclude themselves and their struggles will not solve this. The fault does not lie with individuals struggling with addiction, but with the pharmaceutical companies that pushed opioids onto MILLIONS. We need to hold Big Pharma accountable for the harm they have inflicted and make sure we fund quality treatment programs that are accessible for all.  https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/heroindelaware/2019/08/21/delaware-making-gains-fighting-overdoses-so-why-more-people-still-dying/2011099001/",12,11,0,1,0,0,0,1,165731354838334,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=165731354838334&id=108506830560787

Once upon a time, a minimum wage job could keep a single-parent out of poverty. But the minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living.  Right now, the minimum wage in Delaware is $9.25/hour. But according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, you need to make at least $21.97/hour to afford a basic 2-bedroom rental in Delaware. That means a parent working a minimum wage job right now would have to work almost 100 hours/week just to make rent. We need guaranteed housing, and we need to raise the minimum wage to a LIVABLE wage (and tie it to inflation) so that no one has to struggle to feed, clothe, and support a household on a minimum wage job.",21,18,0,3,0,0,0,1,163456798399123,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=163456798399123&id=108506830560787

Jessica Scarane,,2020-01-10 14:12:53,"A voter asked me: ""What would you replace cash bail with?""   The answer is nothing. Cash bail doesn't serve any purpose except to criminalize poverty. Can’t afford bail? You might remain incarcerated for MONTHS while your case is processed. Meanwhile, a wealthy person in this same situation could walk free and await their trial from home. More than 60% of our prison population are folks who haven't yet been convicted of a crime, and 30% are people who simply can't afford to post bail. Most of these detainees have been accused of low level offenses and are overwhelmingly Black and Latinx. This is a racist and classist system, full stop. Being held for weeks, or even months, destroys lives - people lose their jobs, can't care for their children, and miss payments for rent. Out of desperation, people are more likely to take plea deals so they can be released, even if they are innocent. Our bail system punishes people for being poor. States from Alabama to California have recognized this, and enacted reforms strictly curtailing cash bail. It's about time Delaware joins them, and stops criminalizing poverty.    https://theappeal.org/bail-reform-explained-4abb73dd2e8a/",35,25,0,10,0,0,0,0,162528738491929,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=162528738491929&id=108506830560787

Thankfully no one was hurt, but this is just one act out of many meant to terrorize women seeking health care. It's unacceptable, and we have to put an end to it. Planned Parenthood provides critical health care services to millions of Americans each year for little to no cost, but clinics throughout the country have been a frequent targets of attacks, and Republicans have taken every chance possible to demonize and defund them. When I couldn't afford health insurance, I relied on Planned Parenthood for health exams and birth control prescriptions. I don't know what I would have done if that wasn't an option. I know so many other women who have the same story.    Congress must continue providing crucial funding for Planned Parenthood, and we must continue to defend the constitutional right for everyone to have freedom and control of their own body.

Jessica Scarane,,2020-01-07 12:04:48,"Last week, leaders of the Delaware Republican Party were caught making homophobic and anti-Semitic comments online. I wish I could say I am surprised, but these sentiments are not new, and our country still hasn't fully dealt with our history of oppression and discrimination. And it's not just a Republican issue. Let's not forget that just two months ago, a Democratic State Representative attacked his primary opponent for hosting a drag show fundraiser.  We cannot allow these disgusting sentiments to be tolerated. While members of both parties have condemned these remarks and demanded resignations, our representation in Congress has been quiet. I am calling on our current leadership in Congress, and all Delaware elected officials to condemn this bigotry and to make it clear that hate of any kind has no place in Delaware.  Furthermore, we must reaffirm our commitment to rooting out bigotry in our own party as well. Racism, sexism, homophobia, and religious bigotry are pervasive, all-encompassing problems. We cannot condemn the GOP for their homophobia and anti-Semitism while remaining silent as our fellow Democrats make homophobic and transphobic remarks. As your Senator, I will be a vocal advocate for true equality, and call out all forms of bigotry wherever and whenever I see it. We are ALL neighbors in Delaware, and it is on all of us to demand better. https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/03/politics/delaware-state-gop-leaders-backlash-trnd/index.html",22,20,0,1,1,0,0,1,161357728609030,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=161357728609030&id=108506830560787
Jessica Scarane,,2020-01-05 09:42:29,"When I moved to Delaware, I started tutoring at the West End Neighborhood House, a Wilmington organization that offers programs for children and families focused on education, employment, and housing. I consistently tutored one student, Mekhi, and I felt so lucky when he eventually trusted me enough to ask for advice and share what was going on with his day, his friends, and his family. Over that year I watched him go from trying to convince me that he didn’t have any reading homework to reading chapter books. I also saw his confidence grow and his willingness to speak up for himself blossom.  West End’s work shows that providing wraparound, community-building services to support the whole family leads to stronger neighborhoods and more successful outcomes. But what about students who live a few blocks too far from West End? What about students whose parents are unaware of what West End offers? We can’t expect small, local nonprofits to cover 100% of students’ needs throughout this state and country. When elected, I’ll fight for the federal funding that’s needed to enact this model across the country and ensure all our public schools have the resources they need to be pillars of strength for our communities.

Jessica Scarane,,2020-01-04 09:38:32,"Last weekend, we met a voter who heard for the first time about Chris Coons confirming the majority of Trump’s judges. She was shocked and angry. “You have to make sure that everyone knows about this!” So to honor her wishes, let’s take a closer look at one of the Trump judges Coons voted to confirm to a lifetime appointment on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals: Kurt Engelhardt. In 2013, Engelhardt overturned the convictions of five police officers who shot unarmed civilians during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and then attempted to cover up the shooting.  He was a deciding vote to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act a couple of weeks ago, and he is one of the judges responsible for sending the question of abortion rights back to the Supreme Court, putting every woman — including myself — at risk of having to endure a forced pregnancy. Engelhardt also has a lengthy history of dismissing women’s complaints about sexual harassment, refusing to even offer these women the opportunity to present their case. Kurt Engelhardt is a racist, sexist, anti-civil rights judge who has no business deciding some of the biggest court cases in the country. And since Chris Coons voted to confirm him, Engelhardt has done his very best to rip away our rights and freedoms.  We can’t sit by while people like Chris Coons enable these attacks on our rights — we deserve senators who won't sell us out to Trump's enablers. https://civilrights.org/resource/serious-concerns-nomination-kurt-engelhardt-u-s-court-appeals-fifth-circuit/",26,22,0,1,1,0,2,3,159964785414991,JessforDelaware,/story.php?story_fbid=159964785414991&id=108506830560787

She told me, “I work hard, lots of people work so hard, but we can’t even afford to treat ourselves to a nice dinner. I have to weigh the cost of every single dish when I go out to eat.

When the government does not properly fund programs and services, we're forced to rely on the generosity and whims of the wealthy to dictate where funding is allocated, at a tax advantage to themselves.  My time working with nonprofits showed me exactly how unfair this system is, especially when programs can have their funding cut at any moment. There should not HAVE to be organizations to fight for the rights of young girls and their communities — our government should be addressing their needs already.

On the other hand, in the absence of that safety net, I'm so grateful for the organizations doing admirable and vital work to make our communities safer and more equitable.

People are hurting — they lack good schools, affordable healthcare, and secure housing. Folks have good reason to be skeptical of candidates, and I am committed to meeting people where they’re at.

Jessica Scarane,,2019-11-26 08:02:40,"My birthday is in a few days, and I'll be turning 35! If elected, I will be the first woman to represent Delaware in the Senate, as well as the youngest female senator. If we want a government that votes for our best interests, we have to elect a more diverse body of legislators. But to do this, we need campaign finance reform at the state and federal level. It costs $10,000 just to put your name on the ballot for U.S. Senate in Delaware. And each year, more corporate money pours into campaigns. If elected, I will fight to end Citizens United, pass a 28th Amendment, and move to public financing for campaigns — but I need to get to Washington to do that.

Jessica Scarane,,2019-11-25 09:07:49,"Working across the aisle is not inherently a problem. The problem is when you make compromises that hurt the people you are supposed to represent. Too often, that is what happens when our elected officials talk about “bipartisan solutions.” What they really mean is “we sold you out to protect corporate interests.” Chris Coons has taken nearly half a million dollars from the pharmaceutical industry so far this election, and he is currently sponsoring a *bipartisan* bill that would strengthen pharmaceutical company monopolies and keep drug prices high. I don’t agree with that. I think our Senators should work for US, not the pharmaceutical companies. That's why I'm refusing all corporate pac, pharma executive, and lobbyist money.
