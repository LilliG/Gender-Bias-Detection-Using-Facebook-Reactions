Linda M Wooten for U.S. Senate,,2020-02-29 12:59:17,"I support ""Yes"" on 1.  ""Linda Wooten of Auburn, an independent candidate for the U.S. Senate, said she supports repeal of the law in order to preserve parental choice “to take care of their children the best way they feel fit.” She said that many parents who pushed for the referendum have allowed their children to receive immunizations. “That is not the issue,” Wooten said. “The issue with the mandate is that it takes away the parent’s right to take care of their children in the way that is best” for their own children. “Parents feel this is a dangerous precedent that will grow into more mandates if not stopped,” Wooten said.
