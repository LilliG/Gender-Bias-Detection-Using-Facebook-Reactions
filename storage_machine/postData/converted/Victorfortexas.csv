Victor Harris for U.S. Senate,,2020-01-07 12:41:46,"Foreign Policy: Iran We have been in a grey zone conflict with Iran for at least 15 years. They continue to escalate with no reaction from the US. A bold and risky move by the President. I only hope thought was put into the follow-on moves and countermoves. In the strategic chess game, the US just took a big piece off the board (a Queen maybe). Soleimani will soon be replaced, let's make that a terminal career move for his replacement. Soleimani was on the named terrorist list. If congress had an issue they should have voiced it then. A terrorist on the battlefield is a free target. You put the target packet together and run it up the chain for execution authorization.  Soleimani had a dual persona. No one knows more about dual persona than our reserve component service members- Reservist and Guardsmen. Soleimaniâ€™s terrorist persona got him killed. Sometimes your personas cross over a bit. I don't think Iran is going to dislike the US any more than they already do. Iran is responsible for the instability in the Middle East more so than can be blamed on the US. The risk of leaving the Middle East is that Russia and Iran could end up putting a stranglehold on European fuel supplies. That would be very dangerous! A free Europe is a core national security interest. This only reinforces the need to get off fossil fuels.",6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,112796150245055,Victorfortexas,/story.php?story_fbid=112796150245055&id=111948866996450
