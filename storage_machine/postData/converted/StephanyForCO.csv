"Stephany Rose Spaulding for Senate,Kristen Seidel",Kristen Seidel,2020-03-07 12:01:38,"üíúüíúüíúHave I told you why I'm caucusing for Stephany Rose Spaulding for Senate today? Well there are several.  1) She holds strong progressive values and has proven she will fight for our environment, immigration reform, criminal justice reform, and reproductive justice.  2) she is ready to fight for real campaign finance reform. She knows in order for true reflective democracy we must start breaking down barriers to run 3) She shows up! Stephany understands that we need progressive leaders at every level of government and shows up to make that happen. She spent November's election day making calls for Omar and Juan all DAY to GOTV. 4) This doesn't get talked about enough... Stephany knows how to build relationships to make things happen. Not only does she run the ethnic and women's studies program at a conservative college in the Springs, she has earned tenure as a black woman!! This is because Stephany knows how to stop, listen, and build relationships! 5) She is exciting Colorado's youth to show up! 6) And finally REPRESENTATION MATTERS! Last I checked the Senate is pretty full of a whole bunch of white dudes. We need our Senate to reflect the many experiences of people in our country. It matters!!  Please join me in caucusing for Stephany Rose today!",20,16,0,4,0,0,0,0,2779350088797889,StephanyForCO,/story.php?story_fbid=2779350088797889&id=122640451135546
Stephany Rose Spaulding for Senate,,2020-03-06 11:14:51,"I am glad we have RBG and other justices who are on the side of our rights to safe and legal abortion. But... Who we pick to represent us is not just politics, it‚Äôs about our lives. We are at a dangerous moment in our country, where we could see the rollback of rights to safe and legal abortion.  We can thank the US Senate, and US Senator Cory Gardner, for that. He voted to confirm, and helped push through, Supreme Court justices who are likely to invalidate vital pieces or all of Roe v. Wade. Such a decision will leave low-income women, of which more are women of color, without access to the care they need at one of the hardest times in their lives.  Join me this Saturday to caucus for change. We need a woman‚Äôs voice, a woman of color‚Äôs voice, in our US Senate. Be a delegate for change.

I have heard what they want in leadership. They want someone who puts them, and their families‚Äô needs, first. They want someone who will be a voice we need in these hard and scary times.  We need a voice who will say black lives matter. We need a voice to say it‚Äôs time to stop the oil and gas industry from making our air harder and harder to breathe and our water dangerous to drink. We need a voice who will say health care for all. I am not a politician like my opponents. I am not doing this for my next political opportunity. I am doing this because I believe in people. I believe in love. I believe in change. My goal this month is to raise the final $3770 that we need to reach the potential caucus goers out there.

In 2 weeks, Democratic voters across Colorado will gather in their precincts to caucus for candidates running for U.S. Senate. We want to make sure you have everything you need to Rock the Caucus! Steps to get there! 1) Have you identified your precinct number? If not, please use this link to look up your voter registration information https://www.sos.state.co.us/voter/pages/pub/olvr/findVoterReg.xhtml. Click on the County & District Information tab. Your precinct number is the last 3 digits of the first number listed. 2) Next, identify your precinct caucus site using the following link https://www.coloradodems.org/2020-caucus-locations/. This is where you need to show up at 1:30 PM on Sat. March 7, 2020. The caucus will start promptly at 2 PM, so we recommend showing up a half-hour early to get checked in on time. 3) At your caucus site, you will have the opportunity to share why you support Stephany Rose Spaulding as a candidate for U.S. Senate and her access to the Democratic Primary ballot. This discussion period is very important to the entire caucus process, so make sure it is not glossed over by anyone. You have this right as a voter to discuss.  Some helpful points to make at your Democratic Caucus:  üëâüèæ Stephany is a proven professional and community leader. As tenured faculty and chair of women‚Äôs and ethnic studies at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, she has written policy and managed employees. She also currently serves on the boards of several local, statewide and national community organizations. üëâüèæ She earned 126,000 votes in one of the reddest congressional districts in Colorado as a Justice Democrat, proving she can earn votes from Democrats, Independents and Republicans without compromising her progressive values. üëâüèæ Her 2018 success led her to serve on Phil Weiser‚Äôs, Attorney General‚Äôs transition team. National organizations are already poised to financially support whoever wins the primary for Colorado, so the money is there for anyone to take on Cory Gardner. üëâüèæ Hickenlooper will be on the ballot through petition - getting signatures of voters. And friends don't let friends waste caucus votes! In all seriousness, caucusing after making the ballot through petitions is a strategic way campaigns attempt to remove access to the ballot from other candidates. We are the party of diversity, equity and inclusion--let's not exclude diverse voices. üëâüèæ Additionally, each caucus site should have literature present from our campaign regarding her platform, but here is a copy you can share with your precinct concerning her 21st Century Bill of Human Rights! üëâüèæ Lastly, and most importantly--leave no delegate slot empty. Please volunteer to be a delegate, even if something comes up and you can‚Äôt attend the next assembly we can only send a substitute for someone when you sign up at the precinct caucuses, but we can not retroactively fill a delegate position. So please, leave no delegate position unfilled at your precinct for anyone! Thank you for all of the amazing work we have done together over the past year. It is now about to pay off. Share with your family, friends and neighbors. And let‚Äôs get ready to Rock the Caucus!!!

At this time, the Chinese Exclusion Act was in place as well. And so this racism spread to more than just Japanese Americans: it spread to Chinese and Korean Americans too and lasted beyond WW2. This isn't the first or last time Asians have been targeted either. From modern coronavirus racism to the Chinese Exclusion Act to Japanese internment, they are often the butt of small eyes and accent jokes. And arguably the worst part? It's normalized and the racism is ignored. It is often argued that Asian Americans are not real people of color, because of wage gap statistics and the model minority myth. It's true-Asians often make higher salaries than other races, even white people. But what isn't talked about, is that the Asian community has the largest wealth gap and much of the salaries/wealth from richer Asian Americans comes from the East. As a result, they rarely receive funding. So those ""positive stereotypes"" like being good at math, hardworking, etc creates discrimination in school admissions, workplace hiring, etc. Affirmative action doesn't help this community. And this is when the model minority myth becomes harmful. So on this day of remembrance, it's important to remember to include Asian Americans in the fight for equality and as your next US Senator, I will ensure that no community is left behind. Please commit to caucus on March 7th!",22,13,0,5,0,4,0,1,2743829242349974,StephanyForCO,/story.php?story_fbid=2743829242349974&id=122640451135546

Both sources emit both kinds of pollutants, but motorized vehicles tend to emit more nitrogen oxides while oil and gas operations emit more VOCs.

We wanted to share this message from them on my 41st birthday! ""Forty-one years ago, we were blessed to birth and deliver Stephany Rose to this life. From the beginning, we knew she was spirited and special. She always had a thirst for knowledge. Before she could even read, we‚Äôd find her in a corner attempting to study the Bible‚Äîupside down nonetheless. She wrote her first book in first grade; spent hours reading when her siblings were out playing; and was always the first one up, dressed and ready for school‚Äîeven when we may have been hitting the snooze button for a little extra sleep. Stephany‚Äôs love for learning and spirit carried on into adulthood as she was the first in our family to earn a Ph.D. But having knowledge was never enough for her. Always at the heart of her growth was to use what she learned to challenge situations she perceived as problematic and unjust. When she was 8 or 9 years old she demanded to play a season of little league baseball, not because she was super athletic (she was not); but, because as a girl she felt she should have the same options as her brothers. Imagine being a parent to that! While it may not have always been easy, nurturing her sense of fairness has helped us as a family and community to see things differently. As we celebrate her years in this life, we can look back and see how the different parts of her character have shaped her for this journey of running for the US Senate. Her thirst for and use of knowledge to help make the world fair and just for those who have been overlooked far too long has always been with her. We are honored to run with her because we know her commitment to serving people is shaped in who she is called to be. We hope that you and the people of Colorado will come to see it as well. Please join us in celebrating our daughter as she continues in her journey this side of life. Whether you are able to volunteer, donate and/or vote for her, your support would be a tremendous blessing.

I am the bold and truly progressive choice in this race for our US Senate. Help me become the people‚Äôs choice for our Democratic primary. First, for my birthday, please invest $27, $41 or $100 dollars for our campaign to reach thousands more potential caucus goers in the next 84 days.

Stephany Rose Spaulding for Senate,,2019-11-22 08:13:29,"‚ÄúAbove anything else, my goal has always been to achieve true economic inclusion for Black people.  How can Comcast suggest that it champions diversity and inclusion if it attacks the laws that provide the foundation for economic inclusion? What good are any of their efforts if they are fighting to make it harder for victims of discrimination to be heard in court? Comcast has made this about much more than Byron Allen, and now the civil rights of my children and my community are at stake. To be clear, anything that makes it harder to fight against discrimination is wrong.

No federal law regulates the use of seclusion, and Congress has debated off and on for years whether that should change. Last fall, a bill was introduced that would prohibit seclusion in public schools that receive federal funding. A U.S. House committee held a hearing on the issue in January, but there‚Äôs been no movement since. Nineteen states prohibit secluding children in locked rooms; four of them ban any type of seclusion. But Illinois continues to rely on the practice.
