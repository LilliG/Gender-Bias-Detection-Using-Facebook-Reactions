Amy McGrath,,2020-02-05 16:58:20,"My statement on impeachment vote: For 20 years, I served as a commissioned military officer, fighting to keep our nation safe and protect our democracy. Many of my friends died in combat to preserve the founding principles of our country. What happened in the Senate this week pushed aside fairness and the rule of law in favor of raw partisan politics. The long-term interests of our country took a backseat, yet again. It was clear from the overwhelming evidence provided by the House, and the refusal of the White House to provide the witnesses and documents requested, that the president withheld vital national security assistance to Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate a political opponent. Our national security is not a bargaining chip. For this reason alone, I would have voted to impeach and convict on both counts. Republican senators could have forced the president to tell the American people the truth about withholding national security funding through witnesses and the release of documents. Instead, these senators let the president‚Äôs team order potential witnesses to refuse to testify at House hearings in a blatant cover-up of illegal actions. Senators then blamed House impeachment managers for presenting a ‚Äúweak‚Äù case and gave the lack of such testimony as their primary reason for voting against removing the president.  What is astounding is that we now have a major political party ‚Äî the Republican Party ‚Äî that, with only one exception in the Senate, is no longer serious about its job, its adherence to our sacred constitutional obligations, and doesn‚Äôt have the guts to perform its basic duty to act as a co-equal branch of government and a check on out of control presidential power. Even supporters of the president must realize that the conduct of Republican senators during this process was not an act of bravery, but simply a falling in line so that they wouldn‚Äôt be challenged in their own primary if they dug too deep. They are now a party drifting about with no moral compass, lost at sea, and unable to recognize right from wrong. It now rests in the hands of all of us ‚Äî the voters of all political stripes ‚Äî to reject elected officials who don‚Äôt have the courage to be more than a rubber stamp for their own political party.",5400,4300,14,1000,3,41,11,465,554719181813293,AmyMcGrathKY,/story.php?story_fbid=554719181813293&id=111393882812494

Amy McGrath,,2019-03-06 17:45:18,"‚ÄúThe work of today is the history of tomorrow, and we are its makers.‚Äù -Juliette Gordon Low (founder of the Girl Scouts of America in 1912) It‚Äôs hard to believe March is here. Last month, my family and I took a short trek south to warmer weather. Our ‚Äúfun and relaxing‚Äù trip to visit Mickey Mouse was fun, but relaxing with three kids?... not so much.  March is Women‚Äôs History Month and this week I had to the opportunity to be a part of the first annual ‚ÄúGirl Talk‚Äù at Northern Elementary School in Lexington. I was joined by other professional, passionate women to discuss our careers with the hope of demonstrating to 4th and 5th-grade girls that they can be anything they want to be. It was wonderful being involved in this event helping to inspire the future of our country.   I remember what it was like growing up and being that age here in Kentucky. What I wanted to do with my life was not open to me as a girl.  So many of my own opportunities were made possible thanks to the courageous women of the past who were willing to reach beyond what society told them they could do. As I listened to the girls‚Äô questions, it struck me that one or two of them might have goals that seem impossible to achieve right now. Hopefully, ""Girl Talk"" will remind them to work hard, dream big, and not give up. It‚Äôs a lesson for us all.
