Alisha Shelton,,2020-02-25 09:26:19,"Team Shelton! I usually don‚Äôt address bullies. However let me be clear since other candidates are saying I am being shown special treatment from NDP because I am Black.  The person in this race with me who  is posting that ‚Äúfavoritism‚Äù got me to South Carolina has clearly under estimated the reach and power of my sorority. All the events I attended yesterday were organized by members of Delta Sigma Theta who work in the political sector with the democratic party locally and nationally.  Some of them even spoke at the First in the South dinner. These events were planned surrounding the Congressional Black Caucus hosting the debate to support candidates that look like me. Wait am I be attacked for getting support from people who look like me? I was glad when Jane Kleeb notified all of the Senate candidates because I am a transparent leader. House members shared great strategies that apply to Nebraskans and tips on overcoming  obstacles a person of color faces in politics. Lastly, when I shared that I was entering the race at a vendor fest held by NDP. They told me ‚ÄúOh s***, if I knew a Black woman would be entering this race I wouldn‚Äôt be in it. ‚Äú Yet, I‚Äôve heard a beautifully fabricated story about them being glad another women is in the race.  When people show you who they are believe them, I know exactly who they are. Thanks for showing me more than once!

Alisha Shelton,,2020-02-21 20:21:19,"This is State Senator Adam Morfeld. I first met Senator Morfeld when he worked at Nebraska Appleseed. He was the first person to teach me how to testify on a bill and the points to address when doing so. At a Delta Days at the Unicameral one year, he was instrumental in providing tips to stop the voter ID bill around 2010. Senator Morfeld is informed and has a heart for people. Trust me Nebraska, as a clinician  you do not want to look in the eyes of a  wife, a mother, a husband, or even a child when they plead to you that they tried to get help for their family member but since they never said the ‚Äúright‚Äù words no one intervened. Right here in Nebraska we‚Äôve had people end their life with their own guns. Clinician‚Äôs understand that suicide is impulsive, not planned over several months. It takes one weak moment and as a responsible gun owner I know how procedural pulling a trigger can become. I am deeply saddened that Senator Morfeld‚Äôs life was threatened when he and so many others at the Unicameral are working so hard for US! Great job Senator Morfeld.

As I reflected on Kujichagulia, which means self-determination and is the 2nd principle; I am reminded of the many calls to action I‚Äôve heard over the years. A call to participate in E.I.E and stop gun violence, a call to register voters, a call to boycott voter suppression, a call to boycott our lack of healthcare, and a recent call that changed my life. A call that rose from deep within me, a call that remembered Payton Benson who was shot while eating breakfast, a call that reminded me that our Sandy Hook angels would be 13-14 years old today, a call to run for U.S. Senate and make your problems MY problems. As we close out this month ending our last quarter, if you feel a call to participate please donate to my campaign. We are just $3,000 shy of our goal.
