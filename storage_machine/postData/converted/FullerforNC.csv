Although our campaign fell short this time, I am so grateful to everyone, including Dee, Apryl, Wil, Drew, and so many others all across the state who supported me. Last night, I congratulated Cal Cunningham on his resounding victory, and wished him luck in the general election. Now that the primary is over, Democrats must unite to flip this seat blue. I still believe everyone deserves a fair shot to make it in America, and I’m going to continue the fight to make that a reality.
