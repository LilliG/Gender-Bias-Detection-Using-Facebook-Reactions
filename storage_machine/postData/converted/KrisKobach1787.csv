Kris Kobach,,2019-10-09 10:47:08,It is a sad day for Kansas when one of its cities puts the interests of illegal aliens over the safety of its own citizens. When ICE seeks custody of an illegal alien it is almost always because the alien has a criminal past or is a known gang member. Roeland Park is now going to be releasing those illegal aliens onto the street.,402,279,1,7,12,25,78,37,10156565827787344,KrisKobach1787,/story.php?story_fbid=10156565827787344&id=58550347343
Kris Kobach,,2019-10-08 18:20:47,"Here's the text of a press release from the press conference earlier today. Kobach Calls on Roeland Park, Kansas, to Repeal its Sanctuary Policy,  Calls on the U.S. Senate to Deny Federal Funds to Sanctuary Cities At an Oct. 7 meeting, the Roeland Park, Kansas, Police Chief notified city council members of the police department’s new sanctuary policy. The approval followed a previous meeting in which the ACLU urged the city to adopt a law enforcement policy to welcome illegal aliens. The policy prohibits Roeland Park police officers from placing or enforcing an immigration detainer hold on any person solely for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also prevents local police from notifying ICE when an illegal alien sought by the federal enforcement agency is in their custody unless a specific threat to public safety is known. Former Kansas Secretary of State and current U.S. Senate candidate Kris Kobach is calling on the city council of Roeland Park to repeal its new sanctuary policy and to fully cooperate with ICE. The Roeland Park policy, section III.c. states:  “The Roeland Park Police Department shall not place or enforce an immigration detainer hold on any person solely for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’).”  Section III.e. prevents Roeland Park police officers from notifying ICE when an illegal alien sought by ICE is in their custody:  “The Roeland Park Police Department shall not provide any resources or assistance to ICE officials for the sole purpose of enforcement of immigration or citizenship status unless a specific threat to public safety is known.” Kobach also called on the U.S. Senate to pass a bill denying federal funds to cities that adopt similar sanctuary policies. “It is a sad day for Kansas when one of its cities puts the interests of illegal aliens over the safety of its own citizens,” Kobach said. “When ICE seeks custody of an illegal alien it is almost always because the alien has a criminal past or is a known gang member. Roeland Park is now going to be releasing those illegal aliens onto the street.” Kobach quoted federal law 8 U.S.C. § 1373 which disallows local government officials from withholding the immigration or citizenship status information from ICE. The law states that a local government ‘may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any … official from sending to, or receiving from, [ICE] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.’  “The Roeland Park policy severely restricts its officers from sending this information,” Kobach said. “The city is breaking federal law by adopting this policy, but unfortunately federal law doesn’t include penalties for cities that disobey it. As Senator, I will push to restrict federal funds to sanctuary cities that put American lives in danger. Many lives have been taken by illegal aliens in Kansas. This sanctuary policy increases the chances that more lives will be lost.” Kobach offered three recent examples of Americans killed by illegal aliens in the Kansas City metro area: In March 2016, illegal alien Pablo Antonio-Vitorino fatally shot four people at his neighbor’s home in Kansas City, Kansas. In September 2016, illegal alien Adrian Espinosa-Flores killed Johnson County Sheriff’s Deputy Brandon Collins in a drunk driving collision in Johnson County, Kansas. In February 2007, illegal Ricardo De-Leon Flores killed Amanda Bixby in a car accident in Basehor, Kansas. Dennis Bixby, Amanda’s father, said De-Leon Flores was eluding police when the car he was driving struck and killed his daughter. “Every day, 14 people die in crimes committed by illegal aliens,” he said. “The true number is probably much higher thanks to cities that do not always, or often under-report, crimes committed by illegal aliens.” Bixby is permanently separated from his daughter. He called it a life sentence. “There will be no more birthdays, no holidays, no wedding for me to give her away, and no grandchildren,” he said. “City council members should ask themselves how they would respond to a grieving parent or family when they are asked why they so callously approved this policy.” ###",330,248,4,9,6,5,58,75,10156564315257344,KrisKobach1787,/story.php?story_fbid=10156564315257344&id=58550347343
