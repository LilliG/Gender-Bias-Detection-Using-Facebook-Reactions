" Bluegrass,Maggie Jo Hilliard",Maggie Jo Hilliard,2020-02-16 11:07:37,"There are many more ideas in this race. I‚Äôm offended at the lack of research done before this call was made. This is why voters stay home. This is why no one believes America will change in time to fix our planet.  Amy McGrath is ProWall, ProTrump, ProKavanaugh, AntiMedicare-for-All and changed from independent to democrat to be a politician. She lost in her last run and fumbles on the issues when we need efficiency in office. She was first to file but this is a PRIMARY! The world needs to know she‚Äôs not a replacement for Mitchy policies, nor the only option for smart voters. Google her. Do your research.  If you‚Äôre looking for a litigation attorney with a reputation for standing up to corrupt and powerful institutions, there‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm Maggie Jo Hilliard, and I‚Äôm in this race too. Although I respect her commitment to her country and fabulous fundraising, Amy is not the best person to represent Kentuckians who need healthcare immediately, who have to live with polluted air and water everyday, who work three jobs and still can‚Äôt pay for a dental checkup, who pay 1/9 of their monthly budget for insulin, who face unfair employment practices for lack of a federal fairness action, who are shamed for mental illness and treatment is hard to find, who are fighting to survive addiction that was most certainly corporate-caused, who are grieving another shooting or suicide, who are homeless still from Wall Street greed &/or the last recession, who are fighting for a voice in their government but cannot vote due to draconian and racist historical traditions, who are angry about the lack of judicial processes in our highest institutions and those who are fed up with economic disparities which cause kids to be less educated and underfed.  Why vote for Amy if you can vote for the stronger Republican on the other ticket? #ByeMitch #ByeAmy #ElectMoJo #DitchMitch  Even if the media and the party fail to recognize I‚Äôm in this race - friends, I am in this race!
