Mike Franken,,2020-01-29 12:22:57,"Mr. Dershowitz’s argument that abuse of power does not constitute an impeachable offense because abuse in that context is not covered under civil code has an interesting corollary in the military.  He is saying that the same standard our citizens are held to is not the same standard for our President.  This is interesting logic because the President, or his designated representative, selects our military commanders.  These commanders are held to the standard of probity, specifically abuse of power, from which Dershowitz thinks the President is immune.  Permit me to explain.  Let’s take command of a ship at sea and its unique responsibilities.  The captain is solely responsible for everything, good and less so, onboard.  The captain is entrusted to be an extended arm for the nation and is chosen after succeeding in many successive screenings for competence and trust.  The selection process is by a vote of prior captains, all of whom were chosen under the President’s signature.  So the bottom line is this: the President, the Secretaries of Defense and the Department of the Navy, hold captains responsible for offenses such as abuse of power, but that is not a two-way street.

Mike Franken,,2020-01-28 18:37:28,"“Go along to get along is not an Iowa value”  IA SEN: Mike Franken’s official statement on Senator Joni Ernst’s comments on Biden, Iowa voters Mike Franken, a retired three-star admiral, expressed his concern Tuesday over statements made by Senator Joni Ernst referencing Joe Biden and Iowa caucus goers. Just after yesterday’s impeachment proceedings, Joni Ernst gleefully said that she was “interested to see how [impeachment]…influences Iowa caucus voters.” It seems Senator Ernst gave the game plan away. Impeachment is serious business. It is not a whimsical political tool to influence elections. And I’m not only dismayed that Joni Ernst and Mitch McConnell seem so willing to use impeachment to undermine Joe Biden, I’m aghast that they trumpet it.  As the president stands trial and unfortunate history is being made, Iowa’s Joni Ernst doesn’t just lack impartiality, she lacks integrity. Go along to get along is not an Iowa value in matters of national import. Six years ago, Iowans asked for a senator who would reflect the values of all Iowans and uphold the integrity of our nation’s military. Did Iowa get what they wanted?  I’m thinking that we want a senator who serves Iowa’s wishes, and isn’t blindly obedient to  Mitch McConnell nor fearful of Donald Trump.  It’s time for a sea change. Raised in rural Sioux County and having served this nation for a very long time, I won’t change like Joni has.  .

Mike Franken,,2020-01-03 13:24:17,"My official statement on killing of Iranian Commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq After President Trump authorized airstrikes in Iraq, in an already strained relationship in a weakened region, Mike Franken (VADM, USN(ret.)) expressed his dismay by the President's actions. Iran’s General Soleimani was the second or third most important official in Iran; and while he was guilty of the deaths of Americans and innocent civilians, killing him in a directed strike will generate a response from Iran and its proxies that will cause more loss of life. It is also going to undermine our position in Iraq. My biggest fear with this Administration is coming of age -- an expanded conflict in the Middle East. Tactical feel-good moments are never favorable.” Franken continued, “This Administration, beginning with the withdrawal from the JCPOA nuclear agreement, makes decisions based on populist politics without proper consideration of the long term results. We have placed Iranian leadership in an untenable corner -- a sinking economy, the onset of winter, internal strife, and now the killing of a popular leader. We have reversed the incremental progress to peace in the Gulf and we now must contend with a cornered badger in Tehran. There are no winners in a conflict with 85 million Persians who are likely to see support from the Russians, maybe the Chinese, and perhaps others. This will not go well. Iran is not Iraq, or Syria, or Libya, as detailed simulations and war games have proven. We cannot let unthought through politics at home drive international relations.

Before this presidency, State, Defense, and legislative staff gave unless-otherwise-directed proposals to the NSC to withhold previously approved aid based on events since aid was first approved. In Ukraine’s case, the military aid would be well-document in the nation’s security cooperation plan, and in most cases, the preconditions that Ukraine must do for delivery. Most country teams, like our defense team working under Ambassador Yovanovitch in Kiev, define success by ensuring no superfluous delays ensue. I know of no instance in which a top-down process, a President directing a hold to his staff, was cause of a delay.

Lying in the performance of one’s duties is particularly frowned upon and often results in a truncated term of service, or worse.

Mike Franken,,2019-09-11 10:35:00,"Everyone has an indelible memory of September 11, 2001.  As the anniversary comes once again, I would like to share my own experience and the lessons I learned from 9/11. I was on deployment as the commanding officer of a new US Navy destroyer named after Winston S. Churchill, and fittingly, in the English Channel. I had about 50 British inspectors and training personnel augmenting the 350 sailors under my command that day.  The radio clerk came to me in an engineering space with an out-of-character stern look. The message said that a plane had crashed into the North World Trade Tower.  I asked him to find the executive officer and to keep the message quiet as I thought how it might affect the 40 or so crew members who had family near New York.  It was just a few minutes later when another radioman delivered news of the second plane.  That answered whether it was an accident.  I made a beeline for the command center.  We set best speed for a U.K. port to drop off our riders.   The crew took the news with considerable solemnity.  Numerous crewmembers had family working in the Towers and the anxiety was clearly visible on their faces. I spoke to each one.  The unknown was the worst, but everyone carried on.  The ship grew hushed as we went to heightened readiness and modified battle stations.  We were in a new normal. Gatwick and Heathrow Airports welcomed the extra air coverage that the Churchill’s powerful AEGIS radar provided in identifying aircraft.  We became part of the modified commercial air control architecture from our station thirty miles out to sea.   A most touching moment occurred three days after 9/11.  I was called to the bridge because the German warship Lutjens, with whom we operated before 9/11, wanted to come alongside.  The story has been told by many who witnessed it: As is tradition, the Churchill's crew began manning its rails and the port bridge wing to wish its foreign comrades well on their voyage home. As the Lutjens pulled in closer, a unique sight met the eyes of the sailors aboard the American vessel. The Star-Spangled Banner was flying with the German flag at half-mast on the Lutjens, its crew manning their ship's rails in their blue dress uniforms. As both vessels steamed alongside each other with sailors from both navies rendering honors with crisp salutes, a banner came into view on the German warship. Its message was simple but spoke to the hearts of each and every American on the Churchill that day. ""We Stand by You."" There was quiet on the bridge of the Churchill.  No one said a word.  The realization that the sanctity of the homeland was gone, most likely for the rest of our lives. It meant that our military service in the far reaches of the globe was no longer the front-lines.  Our loved ones were in jeopardy now, too, and we needed to change how to protect the nation. Everyone on the Churchill knew that we could not do this alone. The Germans were with us, the Brits were with us, NATO was there, and like-minded nations from Africa to East Asia were bought into a mutual reliance.   In a career of often being in charge, there is no better feeling to know that you and your cause has supporters.  On that day, my crew felt that same relief. Today we must not only remember the victims, survivors and heroes of 9/11. We must demand our leaders renew the good-faith and support America had in the world. America cannot and should never want to go it alone. VADM M.T. Franken, USN (ret), a native of Sioux County, Iowa, served 36 years in the U.S. Navy.

Mike Franken,,2019-09-07 15:10:02,"Overnight stays at Trump resort and buying fuel at Prestwick Airport helping the resort: Many things come to mind.  First, the US military used that airport to fly short-range logistics flights to aircraft carrier battle groups during the cold war, but it was never a stopover for big wing aircraft.  Second, artificially selecting seaports, airports, and contracts contrary to good business practices put naval officers and enlisted personnel behind bars in the Fat Leonard case. To place careers of military personnel at risk, because the military takes travel improprieties very seriously, for staying at a golfing resort is irresponsible. Sounds like a White House manufactured problem for military personnel.   When I stayed overnight in Prestwick waiting for a helicopter to my warship off the coast of Scotland, I stayed in a WWII-era barracks.

Mike Franken,,2019-09-02 12:49:19,"On this Labor Day, let’s do a shout out to Organized Labor.  Beginning well over 200 years ago, America’s labor movement worked to make possible the concept of a weekend, a 40-hour workweek, 8-hour workdays, job safety, formalized job training, unemployment compensation, and so much more.  The ongoing effort for labor is to ensure a living wage results from an honest day’s work in a just society.  And ultimately, a future in which every family is covered by a health care and retirement plan.  I will stand with workers everywhere on this Labor Day and on every day in the U.S. Senate.",21,18,0,3,0,0,0,2,120051609362849,FrankenforIowa,/story.php?story_fbid=120051609362849&id=110022477032429
Mike Franken,,2019-08-31 14:57:00,"Indeed, employers and elected leaders did not implement the five-day workweek out of the goodness of their hearts. Rather, workers and their unions agitated, lobbied, organized, struck and voted for decades to achieve these gains. As Frederick Douglass, the legendary African American activist, once declared: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”",25,21,0,4,0,0,0,0,118918492809494,FrankenforIowa,/story.php?story_fbid=118918492809494&id=110022477032429
Mike Franken,,2019-08-31 11:56:20,It's simple: inclusion is important. The caucus must be accessible to everyone.
