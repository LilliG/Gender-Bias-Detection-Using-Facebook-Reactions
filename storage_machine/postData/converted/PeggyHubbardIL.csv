Peggy Hubbard,,2020-03-03 14:46:04,"This is my opponent Dr. Tom Tarter, who touts that he is from Springfield in his bio. But, he cut and ran to Schaumburg Illinois. Another politician leaving Southern Illinois behind! He underestimating my dominance in Springfield was actually greater than he thought (So, much for me not having name recognition).  Dr. Tarter IS for mandatory vaccinations for children, regardless of a parent's objections. I was on the fence on the subject being a mother. After researching this topic, I can understand a parent's concern.  Some of these vaccines are made with aborted fetal tissue and cells. And, other ingredients from formaldehyde and things i can't even pronounce! We live in a state that tells parents, they MUST allow boys in girls locker rooms. Also, allowing a minor girl to have an abortion WITHOUT parental consent? Really? But, preach you MUST vaccinate? You can't have it both ways! Illinois state government will penalize a parent for what ever reason they choose for not  vaccinating their child with ingredients that are questionable and could cause harm to a child. And, place a medical burden and stress on a family. I've spoken to parents who children have  suffered adverse reactions to these vaccines. And, it is disturbing. Heartbreaking details. Dr. Tarter is a man of science, no doubt about his abilities. But, not taking the time to LISTEN to a parents concern? Well, his bedside manners are cold and condescending.  Do you want a Senator that turns a deaf ear to a parent? You take an oath as a doctor ""First do no harm"" some children are harmed. So, do you want a Senator that will work to find a solution for safer vaccines, that will not cause harm to a child? I have NO ties to big pharma. My ties are with parents. And, I will protect YOUR rights to say what is best for YOUR child. I will protect YOUR medical freedoms.  #PARENTALCONTROL #peggyforillinois",299,237,0,44,16,0,2,53,1044785672588851,PeggyHubbardIL,/story.php?story_fbid=1044785672588851&id=332176483849777

And our government allowed $158 million of Federal School Lunch Program Funds to pay for lawn sprinklers, among other things in California.

Then that same Democratic party tried to impeach a duly elected President for three years based on the FBI investigation that they started and our taxpayers ultimately paid for in the end.  That didn't work, so they decided to grab on to a routine call with a foreign leader to rally their base all while taking away media coverage from our trade deal and other significant accomplishments from the Trump administration.

Peggy Hubbard,,2019-10-04 22:54:23,"My character and what I stand for has been under attack lately. There has been much discussion regarding my WALKING AWAY from the Democratic Plantation and the falsehood of how much they care for Black Americans. Let me be clear... I left the party when former President Obama turned a criminal into a hero and a decorated police officer into a villain. I researched the Republican Party extensively and saw my beliefs mirrored the Republican Party. All our lives we Blacks were told to keep our head down and vote Democrat. My family once did faithfully without questioning them. There are those in the Republican Party who feel I don't have the right to run, be seen and heard. Ronald Reagan and President Trump were once Democrats and switched parties.  There are some ladies in the Republican Party who are spreading false and misleading information about me. I supported President Trump from day one, and have done over 30 videos on YouTube and Facebook regarding my admiration for President Trump. Yes, I was Democrat, but ever since my awakening, I became a full member of the Republican party. From Republican election judge to a FULL member of the Republican women of Illinois. Yes, I wear wigs because I suffer from lupus, an autoimmune disease that destroys a lady's hair. I would like to wear my own hair, but I can't. Not ashamed.  I helped Mike Bost's campaign, Jeanne Ives' campaign because I believed in them. I 100% I am pro-life, pro-police, pro-second amendment, pro-veterans, pro-Illinoisian, fighting to make the forgotten Americans in our forgotten communities a priority.   My life hasn't been easy. I watched my mother abused by my father. I identified my brother's dead body on the streets after he was a victim of gun violence.  I escaped an abusive marriage with only .37 cents in my pocket and the clothes on my back with two babies in tow. I refused welfare and worked 3 jobs. So, if anyone wants to attack me for being a strong, resilient, articulate, proud, Harley Davidson riding, take NO prisoners, rough around the edges, unapologetically smoking hot black chick who loves her country... GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT! I AM IN IT TO WIN IT AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF I RUFFLE SOME FEATHERS ALONG THE WAY, SO BE IT. #PeggyForIllinois",3800,2300,5,1300,12,0,0,703,917069525360467,PeggyHubbardIL,/story.php?story_fbid=917069525360467&id=332176483849777
