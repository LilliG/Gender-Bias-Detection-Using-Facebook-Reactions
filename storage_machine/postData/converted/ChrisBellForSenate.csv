Chris Bell for US Senate,,2020-03-05 00:15:54,"Last night was tough and I won‚Äôt try to sugarcoat it. I want to congratulate MJ Hegar and Royce West for making it to the runoff and my other opponents for running. I would like to say I‚Äôm sorry to my incredible wife, Alison, who has had to put up with way too much of this, my sons Atlee and Connally, and the friends and supporters who have stood by me and continued to believe. I truly thought It would be different this time but It wasn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm sorry. I guess, by way of explanation, dreams die hard. I loved my time in public service and always wanted another chance. Not for the reasons that some of you probably think‚Ä¶although, at times, it could be fun and heady stuff. For example, it was great to be in Congress and be the most public face advocating for the expansion of light rail in Houston in 2003 and crucifying the flailing chief opponent of expansion during a live television debate. It was great to be able to go on CNN and tell a national television audience that ‚ÄúTom Delay‚Äôs moral compass was demagnetized a long time ago.‚Äù But there were also the things that most didn‚Äôt see: learning from the woman who cut my hair that one of her colleagues adored me because my City Council office had been able to intervene to save one of her pets. Being in a position to organize the rejuvenation of Baldwin Park so that it could go from being mainly a gathering place for drug dealers to become a great neighborhood asset. Those were the silent, unseen victories that made it so worthwhile. I can‚Äôt remember exactly when but, at some point, my friend and fellow Christ Church Cathedral parishioner, Chase Untermeyer, told me that after I left Congress, I would most likely not enjoy traveling anymore. Chase had worked in the George H.W. Bush administration and he knew how incredible it was to travel as a White House official or as a member of Congress. Basically, all you have to do is pack and show up‚Ä¶the rest is taken care of. But what neither Chase nor anyone else could tell me is that my life would never be the same after leaving Congress. Maybe if it had been a little more normal, that would have been one thing. But to watch this extraordinarily corrupt human being, Delay, wire a process in the spineless Republican controlled state legislature so that almost every white Democrat would be redistricted out of Congress  was quite unbelievable. Leaders like Garnet Coleman, Jim Dunnam, Rodney Ellis, Mario Gallegos, Elliot Shapleigh, Leticia Van de Putte, and Royce West didn‚Äôt think it was right and nor did almost all of their Democratic Senate and House colleagues. They fought lIke hell to block the unprecedented mid-decade redistricting. But sadly,  others took the bait and, with victory within their grasp, gave up. So all of that was rather difficult to accept but, Lord knows, I tried. And I kept running. And I didn‚Äôt and, I don‚Äôt, see shame in that. I think people should get back up and try again whether it‚Äôs politics or business, education or love. Life sucks a lot of the time and I don‚Äôt like the idea of surrendering. After losing the race for mayor in 2015, I poured myself back into my law practice and I don‚Äôt think anyone would tell you differently. It was hard, there were ups and downs, but I was certainly trying.  And then in the fall of 2018, something very strange happened:  I had four jury trials within the span of about three months, the last one ending just before Christmas. These weren‚Äôt huge trials, but every trial requires a lot of preparation and it was a bit overwhelming and stressful. But I won them all‚Ä¶and that felt great‚Ä¶for a moment. And then I felt I was right back at the grindstone, dealing with difficult clients, the stress, the anger, etcetera, etcetera‚Ä¶that every lawyer faces. One of the people I love most, Eric Burns, my former congressional communications director, suggested that I consider running for Senate. I told him I couldn‚Äôt leave my law practice to do that. But then my partner at the time, and a great lawyer, Andrew Cobos, said he was fine going out on his own and could take over our docket. That got me thinking about an article written a long time ago by my friend, Jim Zook. While at the Houston Chronicle, he did a profile about John O‚ÄôQuinn, long before John and I had become friends. And the gist of the story was here‚Äôs this guy with more money than he will ever know what to do with, but he keeps finding himself in messy, ugly, controversial situations‚Ä¶why? And there was this quote in the article from Larry Dougherty, another lawyer and friend, and he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough money in the world to fill the hole in John O‚ÄôQuinn‚Äôs life.‚Äù It was such a powerful quote, and I never forgot it. Young people would come to Washington for school trips and I would always (after changing the names) share the story and tell them, ‚ÄúIf you can ever find anything in your life to fill the hole, grab onto it, seize it with everything you have and, don‚Äôt let go.‚Äù That's because I had found something to fill the hole: public service in the United States Congress. I have never been humble about the success my staff and I were achieving there and I was extremely proud. But then, of course, I needed to let go but, I guess, in many ways, I never did. And I‚Äôm sorry. I will always cherish the love, support, encouragement and confidence so many of you have shown. It has meant the world to me and now, it‚Äôs time to look for a new path. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.",19,10,0,9,0,0,0,6,654911158590129,ChrisBellForSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=654911158590129&id=458724334875480

Chris Bell for US Senate,,2019-07-12 11:16:30,"I was disgusted but not shocked at the recent expose by the Dallas Morning News detailing the private, for-profit prison PAC money flowing into the campaign coffers of Texas Senator John Cornyn. Cornyn‚Äôs campaign has accepted $10,000 so far this year from one of the top operators of immigrant detention facilities along our border. The same detention centers that have packed asylum seekers into chain link cages, without adequate food, facilities and healthcare. The same detention centers where sick, scared and in some cases dying children are being warehoused without their parents, without hope, without mercy. When confronted by reporters about his chummy relationship with the immigrant prison industry, Cornyn said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any response.‚Äù Today, in McAllen, John Cornyn and Vice President Pence will tour one of the detention centers in hopes of dismissing all negative publicity. I predict they both will emerge to proclaim that conditions are fine, that the criticisms are the hyper-obsessions of liberal politicians and the media. That‚Äôs what John Cornyn must say to placate his sugar daddies in the for-profit detention industry. Imprisoned asylum seekers are their new cash cows. The inhumanity, the vile and unforgivable mistreatment of desperate souls seeking to escape violence, terror and poverty in chaotic countries is not who we are as Americans. That‚Äôs one of the many reasons I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate to unseat John Cornyn. I want to restore safety and dignity to asylum seekers who come to America seeking a chance at liberty, security and the pursuit of happiness.
