MJ for Texas,,2020-03-04 13:40:42,"Texas Primary results are still coming in, but I want to again thank the incredible supporters who powered us to a first place finish. Y'all stepped up in a big way to put our campaign in this strong position, and I'm so grateful. Loved celebrating with many of you last night!",769,602,1,165,1,0,0,33,2602519469994411,MJforTexas,/story.php?story_fbid=2602519469994411&id=1925751504337881
MJ for Texas,,2020-03-04 00:11:50,"I’m not a career politician. I’m one of millions of Texans who have seen the world we’re giving our children and thought “hell no.” We built our campaign from the ground up together & proved we have what it takes to do something incredible in November: WIN Texas. That starts now. The Texas Primary was the first major test of the powerful grassroots campaign we’ve built. Results are still rolling in, but we’re confident that we’re advancing to the runoff, and we are ready to hit the ground running.  Thank you to every candidate who stepped up to champion their ideas and values. This talented and dynamic field showed that folks across Texas have high hopes for our future. I look forward to working with all of you to move the needle on our Texas values. Our momentum is unparalleled in this race. We’ve met thousands of Texans as we’ve traveled tens of thousands of miles across our great state, earned endorsements from many editorial boards and organizations, and raised more than $4 million from 35,000 donors. This runoff will be hard-fought, but I’ve taken on tough fights my whole life. When I was shot down & fought the Taliban, when I took on the Pentagon to open ground combat roles to women, & when I fought for my life during childbirth I prevailed. Together, we WILL win this one. We have to. If we want to take action on climate change, expand and improve health care, defend reproductive rights, end the gun violence epidemic, pass immigration reform and more — we must win this seat. Our focus is the ultimate goal: defeating an 18-year Senator who’s sold out Texans’ health, safety, and security to special interests, political bosses, and corporate donors. Ours is the only campaign that has what it takes, and this runoff is our opportunity to prove it. So let’s celebrate tonight and get right back to work tomorrow, because we’ve got a message for Sen. Cornyn: pack it up, buttercup, because the people of Texas are coming to take back our Senate seat.
