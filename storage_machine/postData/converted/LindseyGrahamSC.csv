President Trump and his team have given us a sound roadmap on how to safely reopen the economy.  I strongly suggest, as a nation, we follow it.  The best path forward is to follow the guidelines set by President Trump and his team.

Lindsey Graham,,2019-06-13 11:31:25,"Without question, foreign influence in American elections is a growing problem for our democracy.  First, I believe that it should be practice for all public officials who are contacted by a foreign government with an offer of assistance to their campaign ‚Äì either directly or indirectly ‚Äì to inform the FBI and reject the offer.  I made this point to FBI Director Wray during his confirmation hearings. But this has not been recent practice and we saw that come to a head during the 2016 presidential campaign.  During that race, we had a major American political party hire a foreign national, Christopher Steele, to dig up dirt on an American presidential candidate.  As if that was not bad enough, the foreign national compiled an unverified dossier that was then used by the FBI to obtain a warrant against an American citizen and surveil an American presidential campaign.  It has also come to light that the foreign national had a well-known political bias, was doing everything in his power to harm an American candidate‚Äôs electoral chances, and sought to directly influence who the American people elected as their next president. American electoral campaigns should be run by, for, and decided by the American people.  Foreign influence in our electoral process is and has been a problem.  One of the corrective actions that I am pursuing is to ensure that foreign political operatives cannot be allowed to manipulate the American political system.  Changes of this nature will serve our democracy well. Finally, the outrage some of my Democratic colleagues are raising about President Trump‚Äôs comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on President Trump‚Äôs campaign and that information, unverified, was apparently used by the FBI to obtain a warrant against an American citizen.",1300,1000,103,122,10,2,20,0,2050553458405318,LindseyGrahamSC,/story.php?story_fbid=2050553458405318&id=165987503528599

Lindsey Graham,,2019-01-04 13:44:24,"Very sad to hear that Senator Pat Roberts will not be seeking reelection in 2020.   He has a legendary sense of humor and is a delightful man.  He‚Äôs also one of the most effective members of the Senate.  Pat is rock-solid on protecting our nation and the farmer‚Äôs best friend.  As the former Chairman of the Intel Committee, he greatly contributed to our national security.   I look forward to working with Pat and running through the tape between now and 2020.  I wish him and his entire family all the best.",455,341,16,21,10,63,4,0,1811489305645069,LindseyGrahamSC,/story.php?story_fbid=1811489305645069&id=165987503528599
Lindsey Graham,,2019-01-03 15:33:00,"Most Americans want to do two things.  1) They want to secure our border.  Compromise is giving the president the $5 billion we need for wall/border security as a down payment to securing the border.  2) They want to be reasonable to the people like the DACA population.  The DACA population ‚Äî about 700,000 ‚Äî give them work permits ‚Äî three-year work permits ‚Äî so they don‚Äôt have to worry about getting deported any time soon.",588,443,69,48,2,1,25,0,1809878399139493,LindseyGrahamSC,/story.php?story_fbid=1809878399139493&id=165987503528599
Lindsey Graham,,2019-01-03 10:58:36,"President Trump is not going to sign a bill that doesn‚Äôt have money for the wall.  I will tell you exactly how this is going to end.  The president is going to challenge the Democrats to compromise.  If they continue to say no, they will pay a price with the American people.",386,289,42,40,0,2,13,0,1809877595806240,LindseyGrahamSC,/story.php?story_fbid=1809877595806240&id=165987503528599
