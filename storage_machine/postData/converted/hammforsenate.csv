I believe he is using the resources available to him in the current situation to the best of his ability.  And those resources are nothing to sneeze at! Without missing a beat, he encourages us to keep campaigning for him in the remaining primary states, and we are figuring out how to do it.

Support National Nurses United, the Sunrise Movement, and other great organizations on the front lines in the fight for a future we can really believe in now!

Apart from the outside chance that Bernie can still win the nomination, it’s important for Bernie to assemble delegates so that he can maintain the rule changes he achieved in 2016, such as barring superdelegates from voting for presidential candidates on the first ballot. In order for him to have negotiating power, Bernie needs to receive at least 1,200 delegates — he has more than 900 now — so he can introduce minority resolutions. Bernie can also push Biden to commit to progressive appointments. The following article details how this works (excerpt): “The convention's purpose isn't just to officially choose a presidential ticket. At the national convention, the party also codifies its official platform and sets rules for the next convention. To do so, the DNC establishes standing committees on party platforms, rules, and credentials. Each committee must consist of 162 members, and each committee's membership is allocated proportionally by how many national delegates a candidate received during the primary. Therefore, Sanders' performance in the national delegate race will influence how many of his supporters will wind up on these critical committees. If he were to win enough delegates to proportionally receive 81 members on each committee, for instance, he would have a majority. He won't, but getting close to that number — or ensuring that the establishment wing doesn't get much more than that number — gives his wing of the party a tactical advantage while advocating for their policies and the contours of the 2024 or 2028 primary.  One of the most critical bodies in this process is the platform committee, which is responsible for drafting and recommending the official party platform to the Democratic National Convention.” ",2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,149749853233122,hammforsenate,/story.php?story_fbid=149749853233122&id=102588774615897
