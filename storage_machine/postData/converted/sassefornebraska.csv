Ben Sasse,,2020-03-30 21:37:44,"“Hey Ben. I’m trying to explain to my kids why homework still matters when lives are in the balance. Kinda feels like fiddling while Rome burns, doesn’t it? Thoughts?” Great question. C.S. Lewis, one of the 20th century’s wisest writers, wrote a lot — so if there’s a worthwhile debate out there, chances are that Lewis wrestled with it and has something important to teach us. In 1939, the world faced a different crisis: it was about to plunge into WWII. That year, C.S. Lewis, a veteran of the First World War himself, gave a sermon to students titled ""Learning in War-Time,” asking if it was appropriate to continue schoolwork while the world teetered on the brink of war. Lewis says: **War doesn't actually create new circumstances: “it simply aggravates” our worldly situation — and especially our awareness of our mortality — so much that we can no longer ignore it.  **Human culture has always existed “under the shadow of something infinitely more important than itself” — that is, a battle between heaven and hell.  **So if society had “postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure,” there would have been no search for knowledge and beauty at all.  **This war “will fail to absorb our whole attention because it is a finite object,” so it is unable to consume our souls. So, what should we do?  The only thing we can do, and the thing we’re made to do: continue pressing forward.  No, we cannot act like we are unaffected — that would be to turn a blind eye to suffering. But yes, we must keep on keeping on. 6 feet apart, of course.  -Ben P.S. Read the whole essay.

Ben Sasse,,2020-03-28 23:03:59,"""Hey Ben. The TV people who keep saying to wash our hands with soap and hot water are just covering up for the hand sanitizer shortage, right?"" So one of the things I've learned this week is that our moms were onto something with the whole ""hot water and soap are magic"" deal, and not just because Purell wasn't common yet... Here's my 101-version for my kiddos: **We pick up viruses, bacteria, and germs all the time when we touch surfaces.  **When we rub our eyes, pick our noses (admit it), or eat food, we bring all that junk into our bodies.  **Keeping our hands clean is a key to preventing the spread of viruses, including coronavirus.  **Soap and hot water might seem pretty basic but there’s a lot of science under the suds. Soap works because it combines two opposites: water-loving and water-hating aspects. Soap molecules have ""hydrophilic heads"" — this is the part of soap that wants to bond with water. But soap molecules also have a ""hydrophobic tail"" — this is the part of soap that wants to avoid water, and to bond with oils and fats instead.  **The coronavirus is protected by a sort of shell that’s called a lipid membrane. So when we wash our hands with soap and water, the tail of the soap that wants to bond with oils and fats starts to break down the virus’ lipid wall. Then, once the virus is broken apart, the head of the soap molecule that wants to bond with water helps wash the rubble away.  Big picture: soap and water act like a sort of wrecking crew at the molecular level. So nope, I don't think the folks pushing soap+water are engaged in a grand cover-up. At the end of the day, your mom might not be a microbiologist, but she knows her stuff: Wash your hands. -Ben",197,166,5,24,2,0,0,0,1515835871914904,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1515835871914904&id=207425149422656
Ben Sasse,,2020-03-28 22:33:43,"""Hey Ben.  My daughter is doing a project for school and needs data.  What’s your favorite color?"" Julie: Our schools need to step it up. This can’t possibly be important enough to count as homework.   Still…thanks for asking.  It’s RED.  Like “Gooooooo. Big. Red!” It’s Saturday, and I’m a Nebraskan, so I’ve spent a whole bunch of my day thinking about Husker football. The Spring Game is usually a shot in the arm to help us football addicts make it through the offseason. But this year, I join with Husker fans everywhere in mourning the loss of this year’s Red-White scrimmage in Lincoln — which had been scheduled for April 18 — another casualty of this nasty virus.   The Spring Game is a tradition for so many families in our state, and beyond. I mean come on, we sell out Memorial Stadium — 85,000+ strong — for a practice. We’re devoted to our Huskers and we bleed red all year long, not just on Saturdays in the fall. So this year, we must simply look forward to what is to come for our team. And—while I’m still working on getting Coach Frost to set up a weekly Zoom call with me to go over the playbook—on April 18, you can catch me out in the yard, teaching Breck to run a perfect slant route.

Ben Sasse,,2020-03-26 20:31:02,"“Hey Ben. I have always wished for more time with my family, but now that we’re all stuck inside, I realize I might not like any of them. I can’t kill them, right?” Dear Anonymous (or “Mom” as our kids call you), First, well, um, no, don’t kill ‘em.   It goes without saying that this is a terrible time for so many. We know many of our neighbors are suffering. Our hearts can’t not hurt for those whose lives have been turned upside down by this ugly virus and the economic crisis it has brought along with it. But if there can be a silver lining, a degree of redemption of this craziness, it’s surely this: time slowed down, distractions removed, and a closeness inside our own four walls that our families haven’t known for a very long time. Maybe never for some. So as an alternative to murder, let me suggest thinking through new experiences. I’ve seen folks giving their kids cooking lessons (followed closely by Washing the Dishes 101), and have heard about many families watching a great old TV series on Netflix or reading a classic novel together aloud. Audible has free audiobooks right now. Check one out — our families need stories together. Folks can’t wait to get outside as a family, walking the dogs and talking to each other. And waving at the neighbors from a distance. We know this unusual season won’t last, and for many reasons, that’s welcome news. But while we’re at least 6 feet apart from the rest of the world, let’s hold on tightly to the ones right next to us.

Ben Sasse,,2020-03-25 08:56:48,"""Hey Ben. Where the [heck] did all the toilet paper go?!""  Lot of folks have asked this. Last weekend, a buddy spent over 30 minutes in line at a Costco trying to buy toilet paper — not to hoard in a bunker but because his family ran out. Zero left. It’s nuts, and lots of folks are asking why it's happening. Short answer: everybody poops.  Longer answer: To prevent spreading the coronavirus to our friends, neighbors, and co-workers, folks who get this nasty virus need to stay home. Running out of TP is always bad — every situation is dire, but some are more dire than others (just ask any parent who has potty-trained a toddler). So it’s rational that we want to make sure we’re sufficiently stocked.  But what’s irrational is panic buying and hoarding. We saw a lot of that in the past few weeks: One couple in Ohio bragged that they bought TEN YEARS WORTH of TP.  Remember the Seinfeld where Elaine steals all the toilet paper and shouts that she “can't spare a square?” Don’t do that.  Our modern market economy is really good at moving information from the point of sale back up the supply chain. Shifts in consumer demand are quickly relayed to distributers, and from them back to producers. This is how most of our just-in-time economy works.  In the case of toilet paper, that information doesn’t even have to travel around the world. 90% of the toilet paper we use is made here in the United States. When TP started flying off the shelves, supermarkets increased orders, and now manufacturers are ramping up.  Proctor & Gamble has said they’re producing at record levels. Trucking companies are shipping it across the country. Stores are stocking it. Nature is taking care of the rest.  Buy what you need — and perhaps a LITTLE bit more, so you don’t have to go to the store as much during this period of aggressive social distancing. But don’t hoard it! Let the store be your storage.  And also: Thank the grocer who stocked it, the trucker who shipped it, the line worker who creped it (the process of making the paper moist), and the logger who cut it.  I’ll check back later for more questions.  Appropriately stocked, -Ben",185,170,9,5,0,0,1,0,1512504375581387,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1512504375581387&id=207425149422656
Ben Sasse,,2020-03-25 08:22:21,"""Hey Ben. My grandson asked me why the government isn’t just paying to make more antibiotics to end this crisis. What's the answer -- Why don't we?""  We should start with the difference between a virus and a bacteria. I'm not a doctor or scientist -- I'm a historian and business guy, so let me try to tackle it as a dad.   Here's how I've tried to explain it to my kids: **Bacteria can ""throw their own party"" — they are single-cell microorganisms that can live where they want to, like in the dirt or on our food. (And they're not all bad guys -- trillions of them live in our guts, and we need them there to help digest food.)  Bacteria can reproduce on their own.  **Viruses, on the other hand, can't live on their own.  They're smaller than bacteria, and they need a host.  Hosts can be human, or animal, or plant -- but all viruses need something with cells to live off of and reproduce.   While the bad ones of both kinds can make their way into our bodies and make us sick, only bacteria -- which can cause stuff like sinus or ear infections -- are killed by antibiotics.  Viruses aren't.  Viruses are beaten back by our bodies’ own immune systems, so we treat the symptoms of the sickness to help our body fight them off. And since viruses need to live in a host, we wash our hands and clean the places we touch, so that a virus that escapes when an infected person coughs or sneezes can’t get into our bodies.  We have researchers working feverishly to find drugs to treat and someday prevent this nasty virus and its vicious grip on our world, but there’s plenty we can be doing to slow it down.  So, besides washing our hands and burying our coughs/sneezes in elbows, my wife is pretty much constantly shouting at my kids to STOP TOUCHING THEIR FACES! since most of the virus entry-points into our body are there.  But antibiotics can't kill a virus. -Ben",211,189,4,17,1,0,0,0,1512479388917219,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1512479388917219&id=207425149422656
Ben Sasse,,2020-03-23 23:09:12,"""Hey Ben, I feel like I’m supposed to support quarantining, but I’m afraid that the feds could make us a police state. Could that happen?"" I’m getting this question a lot, and I’ve got a couple minutes for some quick thoughts – though there’s lots more to say.  Last week, California effectively placed 40 million free people under lockdown — and Illinois and New York are flirting with similar plans.  Three quick thoughts: First, in my view, the Governor of California doesn’t have the blank-check power he thinks he does. Obviously, everyone should be doing responsible social distancing right now and the spring break frat bros partying at crowded bars are idiots. There are decent arguments for states to temporarily regulate things like restaurant density and crowd size. But the idea that government should grab the kinds of power California wants without more debate about tradeoffs is deeply disturbing. Everything in life has tradeoffs and politicians who don’t admit that are lying. Second, at the federal level, nothing in the Constitution allows Washington to do this kind of thing – and folks should let Congress know that. Fortunately, there are lots of freedom-loving people here, like Mike Lee who has been shouting “Over my dead body!” at any possible overreach in this arena. So, I don’t envision any near-term national risk. But....last point, we need to pay close attention to the eerie experiments we see governments around the world undertaking. Taiwanese citizens, for example, have reported police tracking them down immediately after their phones leave their homes. That’s a government with far too much power. When governments grab more power, they tend to hold onto it for a long time.  This virus is ugly and dangerous — but we’re going to beat it and it isn’t the only ugly and dangerous problem we need to guard against.   We’re still working on the coronavirus relief legislation/negotiations, but keep throwing these questions my way. I’ll do my best. -Ben",439,398,0,37,1,0,3,0,1511262785705546,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1511262785705546&id=207425149422656
Ben Sasse,,2020-03-23 22:12:35,"""Ben, I keep hearing we’ll end up like Italy on this virus, but my friends say that’s [BS]. What’s going on?""  You’re not alone in asking that question, and the answer, I think, is complicated.  The data showed, and I argued two weeks ago, that we seemed to be on the “Italian curve,” with cases in the U.S. doubling every three days at that point.  Since then, the pace of positive corona tests has quickened to a doubling every 2.1 days.  The graphs, at face value, are scary. And it’s easy to see how these numbers cause some of our neighbors to panic, especially when many social media sources suggest we should panic.  I think the answer to your question is one that’s hard for many politicians and pundits to admit – because we all like to pretend we have certainty about what’s coming next – but the answer we should give is: We don’t know; we’re not sure.  Two things appear to be at play at once. We do have some ugly acceleration of the underlying disease – but we also have lots more testing, so we are now SEEING more of the disease that was already here and spreading before we started pushing down on the curve a bit via social distancing.   Stated simply:  Some of the increase in positive tests is because of more disease, and some of the increase in positive tests is because of more testing – not just more disease.  It’s obviously good that we have increasing testing capacity (and ATV [""after the virus""] we’ll need to go back and assess how the country and government failed so badly to make more testing capacity available more rapidly). But one minor downside to this better and broader testing is that many people who previously didn’t take the virus seriously are now convinced that everything bad is just beginning now – as they see these spiking graphs for the first time.   There is a newfound public awareness of crisis (which has actually been here for a while), which then produces a lot of possibly-misplaced certainty that we are spiraling downward toward the devastating images we see coming out of Italy. That knee-jerk certainty puts serious pressure on those politicians who have placed extreme restrictions on their citizenry — the shelter-in-place kind of stuff — that they can’t possibly pivot to more nuanced or better targeted social distancing regimes. That horse of extreme shutdown is already out of the barn, and without any parameters on how or when it should go back in.   Here’s the problem with that: If, in coming days and weeks, the rate of the threat to public health isn’t actually accelerating, there will remain dangerous pressures not to lift lockdowns and alter bans – because the number of diagnosed cases is almost certainly going to continue to climb (because of broader testing) even if the underlying prevalence of cases might have leveled off.   The worst thing leaders can do for America is to gut the private sector, where our economy lives and breathes – or better put, where our families live and breathe and eat and set aside savings for a wedding or downpayment.   We have to guard against poisoning ourselves with the wrong medicine. And we need politicians to govern with informed data as they balance protecting our health on the one hand, and preventing our businesses and industries from evaporating or becoming government dependencies on the other.  Stuff is changing really fast right now, but I'll be back on later to share some more back and forth.  -Ben",384,364,0,15,0,0,5,0,1511219552376536,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1511219552376536&id=207425149422656

Ben Sasse,,2019-11-22 07:55:52,"NEBRASKA CREATED 6-MAN FOOTBALL We love football. We love every kind: fall and spring, big-city and small-town, smashmouth and backyard touch, all of it. Oh, and we also love every team size: full 11-man, spread formation 8-man, and Nebraska’s own invention: 6-man. Small town, Friday night — it’s a thing of beauty. Over the course of the next week, the Nebraska School Activities Association will crown seven state champions. Kicking off tonight in Kearney, the 6-man state championship will feature the undefeated McCool Junction Mustangs vs. the undefeated Harvard Cardinals. Wanna make a bet that can’t go wrong? It’s this: Loads o' touchdowns. Nebraska invented 6-man football back in 1934, and there's nothing quite like it. It's fast and chaotic. There’s no such thing as specializing — you play both sides of the ball. It’s gorgeous and exhausting. Compared to its bigger brothers, 6-man’s rules are a bit different: **Each team plays only 6 athletes at a time. **The field is 80 yards long and 40 yards wide (vs. 100 x 53 in traditional 11-man). **You gotta get 15 yards, not 10, for a first down. **Extra points count for two. Field goals count for four. **All players — including your 5’7” 265 lbs. center — are eligible to catch a pass. But just like every football game, from Harrison in Sioux County to Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, 6-man takes grit and toughness. Hard work and selflessness. Passion and pride. The real reason Nebraskans love this stuff is because the things that make football great are the same things that make our state great (of course, the Huskers winning five National Championships since 1970 helped, too). A lot of these teams come from rural communities with populations of 200-500. Some 6-man teams barely have 11 names on their rosters — their schools just don’t have the enrollment numbers to field a larger team. But these kids just want to play football. For decades, that small-town determination drove our state forward. It still does. Right now, I’m in the middle of another 93 county campaign tour. My family and I are back out on the road in the RV stopping in communities across our state. Here’s something we’ve been talking about a lot: Yes, times are changing in small towns, for better or worse, but the values we learned in small-town Nebraska are the same values that make our state a special place today. Nebraskans have grit and toughness. We've built a foundation of hard work and selflessness. We share a deep passion and communal pride. Our state is built on the kind of stuff we're going to find in Kearney and Memorial Stadium this week. Best of luck to the teams competing for championships — have fun, make some memories, and hit somebody hard. --- Photo via Omaha World-Herald: https://bit.ly/2Oa0iF2",472,417,1,52,1,0,1,0,1394369660728193,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1394369660728193&id=207425149422656

Ben Sasse,,2019-08-22 21:35:00,"PRAY FOR ZAK You need to meet Zak Palmer. This past week, our 93 county tour brought us back to the village of Springview in Keya Paha County, Nebraska. It's a community of a couple hundred—and yet it seemed like half the downtown had #ZakStrong signs up, so we stopped in town and asked what #ZakStrong was all about. Zak's a local high school athlete. He’s a good student. A three-year qualifier for state wrestling. He helped lead his team to the Class D1 football playoffs last fall, and, most recently, finished third in the state triple jump. Soon after competing at state track, he received a nightmare diagnosis: Leukemia. Which is crazy to think about—Zak finished in the top 3 while his body was fighting LEUKEMIA. That’s the kind of tough this young man is. His family has pulled together, fighting this battle with faith and a determination to be there for Zak. His dad, Bruce, told a local paper, ""My wife (Julie) and I gave our children to the Lord when they were born—this battle is in his hands now.” Amen.  The other Palmer kids have been helping run the ranch while Zak’s parents have been in Sioux Falls with Zak during treatment. And just last week, three counties came together and held a fundraiser for Zak.  From what I can tell, it seems like the whole town swung into action. People from all over donated items to the fundraiser, and get this—Zak’s wrestling teammates didn’t have any items or money to donate, so they donated themselves: volunteering to do a days work for people who would donate money to help Zak. Over 400 hundred people from the neighboring three counties came out for this event. They raised over $50,000 for Zak’s medical treatments.   Zak and the Palmer family have a long road ahead after his first round of treatments, but they’re surrounded by love. Their family, their church, their town, and the three surrounding counties are all standing with them. I haven't been able to get these Nebraskans out of my head.  Three small thoughts here: 1. At a time when the idea of community is disappearing all over America, these people are a shining example for all of us of what happens when we come together to love and serve our neighbor. Wherever we live, in a small town or a big city, may we all strive to make the community we live in more like Springview, Nebraska. 2. I don’t want to presume everybody has the same theology I do, but as a Christian, I was blown away by the example of Zak's parents. Melissa and I have three kids. When they're born, you try to keep them as safe as you can, while praying every day that nothing bad happens to them. You do all this work, and you act like you're in control, but you're not. Not for one second.  It’s easy for us to say we follow Jesus. It’s hard for us to actually do it. At some point in our lives, Christ calls each of us to take up our Cross and follow Him.  Most of us never really have our faith tested the way the Palmers are right now. (Praise God.) Zak’s parents are living a nightmare every parent prays they never experience, and yet, they are trusting the Lord through this trial with a clear, public profession of faith in Him.  They're an example for every parent, and for all of us as Christians. 3. I hope we all hug our kids extra tight tonight. This coming week, if you would, please join our family in praying for Zak and his family, praying for strength for them, and the same kind of faith for ourselves, never forgetting that this kind of faith and love of neighbor is what makes makes Nebraska the most special place in the world to live.  Thanks. --- Photo via Norfolk Daily News:  http://norfolkdailynews.com/sports/area-athlete-battles-his-biggest-foe-leukemia-head-on/article_2a3d78a6-9d9b-11e9-a083-13623de930c5.html",2600,1700,1,879,17,64,0,0,1313769585454868,sassefornebraska,/story.php?story_fbid=1313769585454868&id=207425149422656
