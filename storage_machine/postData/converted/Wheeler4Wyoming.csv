Josh Wheeler For U.S. Senate,,2020-03-25 01:54:59,"The reports are that the truckers are getting supplies to the stores. People are stocking the shelves all night and letting old people shop first. Carnival Cruise line told Trump ‚ÄúWe can match those big Navy Hospital ships with some fully staffed cruise ships‚Äù GM said hold our cars and watch this; we can make those ventilators where we were making cars starting next week. Women and children are making homemade masks and handing out snacks to truckers. Restaurants and schools said, We‚Äôve got kitchens and staff; we can feed kids.‚Äù Churches are holding on-line services and taking care of their members and community. NBA basketball players said, ‚ÄúHold our basketballs while we write checks to pay the arena staff.‚Äù Construction companies said, ‚ÄúHere are some masks for the medical staff and doctors‚Äù. Breweries are making sanitizer out of the left-over ingredients. We thought we couldn‚Äôt live without Baseball, NASCAR, NBA or going to the beach, restaurants or a bar. Instead, we‚Äôre trying to keep those businesses open by ordering take-out. And many are making a difference by just being still, a virtue thought to be lost.  What communist China didn't count on was America saying ""Hey, hold my beer and watch this."" I think a Japanese Admiral in the middle of the Pacific said it best in 1941, ""I think we have awakened a sleeping giant."" Give us a few more weeks (maybe months) and we will be doing much better!

Josh Wheeler For U.S. Senate,,2019-11-27 15:29:31,"On Jeopardy the final question was, How many steps does the guard take during his walk across the Tomb of the Unknowns? ------ All three missed it --- This is really an awesome sight to watch if you've never had the chance Very fascinating. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 1. How many steps does the guard take during his walk across the tomb of the Unknowns and why? 21 steps. It alludes to the twenty-one gun salute, which is the highest honor given any military or foreign dignitary. 2. How long does he hesitate after his about face to begin hisreturn walk and why? 21 seconds for the same reason as answer number 1 3. Why are his gloves wet? His gloves are moistened to prevent his losing his grip on the rifle. 4. Does he carry his rifle on the same shoulder all the time and if not, why not? He carries the rifle on the shoulder away from the tomb. After his march across the path, he executes an about face and moves the rifle to the outside shoulder. 5. How often are the guards changed? Guards are changed every thirty minutes, twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. 6. What are the physical traits of the guard limited to? For a person to apply for guard duty at the tomb, he must be between 5' 10' and 6' 2' tall and his waist size cannot exceed 30.' Other requirements of the Guard: They must commit 2 years of life to guard the tomb, live in a barracks under the tomb, and cannot drink any alcohol on or off duty for the rest of their lives. They cannot swear in public for the rest of their lives and cannot disgrace the uniform {fighting} or the tomb in any way. After two years, the guard is given a wreath pin that is worn on their lapel signifying they served as guard of the tomb. There are only 400 presently worn. The guard must obey these rules for the rest of their lives or give up the wreath pin. The shoes are specially made with very thick soles to keep the heat and cold from their feet. There are metal heel plates that extend to the top of the shoe in order to make the loud click as they come to a halt. There are no wrinkles, folds or lint on the uniform. Guards dress for duty in front of a full-length mirror. The first six months of duty a guard cannot talk to anyone, nor watch TV. All off duty time is spent studying the 175 notable people laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. A guard must memorize who they are and where they are interred. Among the notables are: President Taft, Joe E. Lewis {the boxer} and Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy, {the most decorated soldier of WWII} of Hollywood fame. Every guard spends five hours a day getting his uniforms ready for guard duty. ETERNAL REST GRANT THEM O LORD, AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT SHINE UPON THEM. In 2003 as Hurricane Isabelle was approaching Washington , DC , our US Senate/House took 2 days off with anticipation of the storm. On the ABC evening news, it was reported that because of the dangers from the hurricane, the military members assigned the duty of guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier were given permission to suspend the assignment. They respectfully declined the offer, 'No way, Sir!' Soaked to the skin, marching in the pelting rain of a tropical storm, they said that guarding the Tomb was not just an assignment, it was the highest honor that can be afforded to a serviceperson. The tomb has been patrolled continuously, 24/7, since 1930. God Bless and Keep Them I don't usually suggest that many posts be shared, but I'd be very proud if this one reached as many people as possible. We can be very proud of our young men and women in the service no matter where they serve.
