Teresa Tomlinson,,2019-12-19 07:24:01,"Yesterday, Donald Trump became the third President to be impeached by the House of Representatives. In the debate of the impeachment article of the #Constitution, a challenge was posed: A senate which was of the same political persuasion as the President would never vote to impeach. Alexander Hamilton responded forcefully that it would be the senators‚Äô own political self-interest that would prevail.  Hamilton asserts that upon evidence of impeachable acts and the attempted manipulation of the trial by senate leaders, the senators will vote to convict the president or they will allow the president to become the author of their ‚Äúmismanagement and disgrace‚Äù. And, in that, the American people would hold those senators politically liable for their failure to impeach. See Federalist Paper, No. 66 to read it for yourself. https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed66.asp ‚ÄúSo far as might concern the misbehavior of the Executive in perverting the instructions or contravening the views of the Senate, we need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their own authority. We may thus far count upon their pride, if not upon their virtue. And so far even as might concern the corruption of leading members, by whose arts and influence the majority may have been inveigled into measures odious to the community, if the proofs of that corruption should be satisfactory .the usual propensity of human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of their mismanagement and disgrace.‚Äù",173,136,1,28,1,1,6,45,2735728456464616,TeresaPikeTomlinson,/story.php?story_fbid=2735728456464616&id=171730749531079

Picture it: run a formidable woman, from outside Metro Atlanta, who has stellar name recognition in central and south Georgia, and Republican rural strategy will be torpedoed!
