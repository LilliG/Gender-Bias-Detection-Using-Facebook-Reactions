With a scholarship (and a lot of student loans) I got an opportunity that kids from Orangeburg don’t usually get: an education at Yale University. After college, I came back to S.C. and taught 9th grade ✏️📚, ran a nonprofit for low income students, worked forJames E. Clyburn, and eventually got a degree from Georgetown Law.  Which brings us to today. Rural hospitals are closing, young people are saddled with huge student loan debt, and poor kids *still* aren’t getting the opportunities they deserve.
