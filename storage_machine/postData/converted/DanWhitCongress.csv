Dan Whitfield for Senate 2020,,2020-02-25 16:48:29,"https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/?fbclid=IwAR0PAM_gzku6BnLi0iMObqIgHLY_xzYm8RFFtTg-XfAwWCgf_oJb-T6vA-s How we will pay for it:  College for All and Cancel Student Debt It will cost $2.2 trillion to make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free and to cancel all student debt over the next decade. It is fully paid for by a modest tax on Wall Street speculation that will raise an estimated $2.4 trillion over ten years.  Expanding Social Security Bernie‚Äôs bill to expand Social Security will increase benefits for low-income senior citizens and people with disabilities by more than $1,300 a year. It is fully paid for by making the wealthiest 1.8 percent of Americans ‚Äì those with incomes over $250,000 a year ‚Äì pay the same rate into Social Security as working families. This bill will also extend the solvency of Social Security into the year 2070 ‚Äì ensuring that Social Security can pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 50 years. Housing for All Bernie‚Äôs proposal to guarantee housing as a human right and to eliminate homelessness will cost $2.5 trillion over the next decade. It is fully paid for by a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of one percent ‚Äì those who have a net worth of at least $32 million. (Bernie‚Äôs wealth tax will raise a total of $4.35 trillion.) Universal Childcare/Pre-K Bernie‚Äôs proposal to guarantee universal childcare and pre-school to every family in America who needs it will cost $1.5 trillion. It is fully paid for by a wealth tax on the top 0.1 percent ‚Äì those who have a net worth of at least $32 million. (Bernie‚Äôs wealth tax will raise a total of $4.35 trillion.) Eliminating Medical Debt Bernie has introduced a proposal to eliminate all of the $81 billion in past due medical debt held by 79 million Americans. It is fully paid for by establishing an income inequality tax on large corporations that pay CEOs at least 50 times more than average workers. Green New Deal The $16.3 trillion climate change proposal that Bernie has introduced will fundamentally transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and towards energy efficiency and renewable energy. It will also create 20 million good-paying union jobs in the process. It is fully paid for by: Raising $3.085 trillion by making the fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution, through litigation, fees, and taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies. Generating $6.4 trillion in revenue from the wholesale of energy produced by the regional Power Marketing Administrations. This revenue will be collected from 2023-2035, and after 2035 electricity will be virtually free, aside from operations and maintenance costs. Reducing defense spending by $1.215 trillion by scaling back military operations on protecting the global oil supply. Collecting $2.3 trillion in new income tax revenue from the 20 million new jobs created by the plan. Saving $1.31 trillion by reduced the need for federal and state safety net spending due to the creation of millions of good-paying, unionized jobs. Raising $2 trillion in revenue by making large corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Key Points: By averting climate catastrophe we will save: $2.9 trillion over 10 years, $21 trillion over 30 years and $70.4 trillion over 80 years.  If we do not act, the U.S. will lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century in economic productivity. Medicare for All According to a February 15, 2020 study by epidemiologists at Yale University, the Medicare for All bill that Bernie wrote would save over $450 billion in health care costs and prevent 68,000 unnecessary deaths ‚Äì each and every year. What our current system costs over the next decade: Over the next ten years, national health expenditures are projected to total approximately $52 trillion if we keep our current dysfunctional system.  How much we will save: According to the Yale study and others, Medicare for All will save approximately $5 trillion over that same time period. $52 trillion - $5 trillion = $47 trillion total How we pay for it: Current federal, state and local government spending over the next ten years is projected to total about $30 trillion. The revenue options Bernie has proposed total $17.5 Trillion $30 trillion  + $17.5 trillion = $47.5 Trillion total  Sources: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsProjected https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext#%20 Since 2016, Bernie has proposed a menu of financing options that would more than pay for the Medicare for All legislation he has introduced according to the Yale study. These options include: Creating a 4 percent income-based premium paid by employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. In 2018, the typical working family paid an average of $6,015 in premiums to private health insurance companies.  Under this option, a typical family of four earning $60,000, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All on income above $29,000 ‚Äì just $1,240 a year ‚Äì saving that family $4,775 a year.  Families of four making less than $29,000 a year would not pay this premium. (Revenue raised: About $4 trillion over 10 years.) Imposing a 7.5 percent income-based premium paid by employers, exempting the first $1 million in payroll to protect small businesses. In 2018, employers paid an average of $14,561 in private health insurance premiums for a worker with a family of four. Under this option, employers would pay a 7.5 percent payroll tax to help finance Medicare for All ‚Äì just $4,500 ‚Äì a savings of more than $10,000 a year. (Revenue raised: Over $5.2 trillion over 10 years.) Eliminating health tax expenditures, which would no longer be needed under Medicare for All. (Revenue raised: About $3 trillion over 10 years.) Raising the top marginal income tax rate to 52% on income over $10 million. (Revenue raised: About $700 billion over 10 years.) Replacing the cap on the state and local tax deduction with an overall dollar cap of $50,000 for a married couple on all itemized deductions. (Revenue raised: About $400 billion over 10 years.) Taxing capital gains at the same rates as income from wages and cracking down on gaming through derivatives, like-kind exchanges, and the zero tax rate on capital gains passed on through bequests. (Revenue raised: About $2.5 trillion over 10 years.) Enacting the For the 99.8% Act, which returns the estate tax exemption to the 2009 level of $3.5 million, closes egregious loopholes, and increases rates progressively including by adding a top tax rate of 77% on estate values in excess of $1 billion. (Revenue raised: $336 billion over 10 years.) Enacting corporate tax reform including restoring the top federal corporate income tax rate to 35 percent. (Revenue raised: $3 trillion ,of which $1 trillion would be used to help finance Medicare for All and $2 trillion would be used for the Green New Deal.)

Dan Whitfield for Senate 2020,,2020-02-05 10:55:27,"Why should someone vote for me?  Because we need change. They claim our economy is stronger than ever, yet 50% of working Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. They say our unemployment is at an all time high, yet 40% of working Americans have low wage jobs or even work multiple low wage jobs.  Here in Arkansas 1/4 children go to bed with a hungry stomach, yet we can find $169 million to build La Salle a new private prison to house 500 people, when we could free space by expunging non violent cannabis charges instead.  Here in Arkansas we are home to Walmart, the largest corporation in the world, yet we pay the highest taxes in America while they pay less than 2%. We pay the highest taxes in our nation we also have nearly the lowest income per capita.  These are all problems we are facing that have nothing to do with what political party you are part of. These are all problems both democratic and republican Arkansans are facing. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre die hard red or blue we still pay the highest taxes and suffer the lowest incomes.  We need change and we need it now.

My boss let me leave work and take her to urgent care. The first Mercy clinic in Lowell we went to was right next to our work. After the guy at the counter tried to find our insurance for 10 mins he asked if we had an appointment. We said no, she needs to see a doctor because her throat is swelling. He then informed us that walk in ended an hour ago and we would have to go to the urgent care on the other side of a different town. We get to the Mercy urgent care in Rogers where we are seen by a nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner examines her and tells her she is having an allergic reaction. She gives my wife a Benadryl and tells us we need to go to the Mercy Emergency room in the next town over to get an IV drip of a steroid to prevent her throat from closing. So we get to the Mercy Emergency room in Bella Vista where she waits and is seen by a doctor. The doctor examines her and tells her her throat is inflamed most likely due to a virus, the common flu. The doctor says that my wife doesn‚Äôt need any steroids and sends her on her way. My wife then receives a $863 bill from the Mercy Emergency facility. This doesn‚Äôt include the Urgent care facility bill, the urgent care physician bill, or the Emergency doctors bill. This is only one of what I am sure are many bills to come.

Dan Whitfield for Senate 2020,,2019-11-29 14:05:27,"Tom Cottons 2012 congressional policy: -Promote Job Creation- Excerpt: ""Beware of politicians who promise to create jobs, because only businesses and entrepreneurs‚Äînot politicians‚Äîcan create jobs."" FACT: Since 2012 the average household income for Arkansans has increased at HALF the national average. Our wages have remained mostly stagnant. Arkansans are working more jobs just to barely get by and live paycheck to paycheck.  -Stop the Spending and Cut the Debt- Excerpt: ""Our country faces a debt crisis because of Washington‚Äôs reckless spending and borrowing. The federal debt is now $15 trillion, the size of the entire American economy."" FACT: Since 2012 the national debt has increased from $15 trillion to $23 trillion! -Reduce and Simplify Taxes- Excerpt: ""Our taxes are too high and too complicated. The individual and corporate tax codes distort the financial decisions of individuals and businesses, leading them to base spending, investment, and saving on tax considerations, not economic benefits."" FACT: The latest tax bill Cotton voted on INCREASED Americans income taxes in 2018 by $93 billion! The middle class and small businesses saw huge increases in taxes while billionaires and giant corporations saw trillions in cuts. The family that gave him $8.4 million in 2014 consequently saved $25 billion in August in exchange for their ‚Äúcampaign contribution.‚Äù  -Repeal and Replace ObamaCare- Excerpt: ""ObamaCare is a job-killer, a health-care disaster, and an assault on liberty. I will fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions."" FACT: The healthcare system has greatly failed us despite what politicians want you to think. Americans are DYING because they can not afford their medicine, while the top 5 pharma companies profits over $100 billion last year. The number 1 cause for bankruptcy in America is medical debt, while 70% of Americans that file bankruptcy for medical debt HAVE health insurance! -Secure Energy Independence- Excerpt: ""America has the world‚Äôs largest fossil-fuel reserves in the world. I view our fossil fuels as a valuable asset to be used, not an embarrassing liability to be restrained. In Congress, I will support policies that unleash our energy producers, put America on the path to energy independence, and reduce our dependence on unreliable and hostile countries."" FACT: The deregulation of the fossil fuel industry has led to a climate catastrophe. Millions of people have been displaced, millions have died form famine and drought, and the environmental impacts have led to hundreds of thousands of Americans getting sick. No one has benefited from the deregulation of the fossil fuel industry, EXCEPT, the corporations that lobbied billions into our legislators pockets in exchange the legislation that benefited them.  -Protect National Security- Excerpt: ""The foremost responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the common defense."" FACT: The United States has been invaded zero times since 2012. Since 2012 more than 225,000 civilians have been killed in the middle east. Between 2012 and 2018 the US dropped 21,063 bombs in the middle east. We have failed at policing the world. Providing for the common defense has benefited NO ONE except defense contractors, and the military industrial complex.  Secure the Border and Enforce Immigration Laws- Excerpt: ""America is a nation of immigrants, but it is also a nation of laws. Our federal government is failing at a core duty: protecting our borders and enforcing our immigration laws. In Congress, I will oppose amnesty in all forms, fight to secure our borders, and improve enforcement of the immigration laws.""- FACT: This has led to children being caged, at the expense to tax payers for $22,000/child/month. Hate crimes have spiked, people are divided over race and religion, and we haven't even reduced the amount of drugs coming into our country through the southern border. We need legislators that actually understand the immigration process and don't hate a person simply for the color of their skin or the way they worship god.  -Promote Parental and Local Control in Education- Excerpt: ""In Congress, I will work to empower parents with better information and more options to make the right choices for their children‚Äôs education and I will work to restore local control over our educational system."" FACT: Arkansas still has some of the lowest paid teachers in America, Arkansas still has some of the lowest rated education in America, and Arkansans are suffering because of this. We need REAL comprehensive legislation that will actually help improve the quality of our educational system, not just for private schools, not just in urban areas, but for all Arkansans. -Defend Traditional Values- Excerpt: ""Strong families are the cornerstones of a strong, free, and prosperous country. As your congressman, I will work to strengthen families and I will stand up for the traditional values I learned growing up on my family‚Äôs farm."" FACT: Gay marriage is NOT WRONG. God never said homosexual relationships are bad! This is fear mongering hate talk that has NO BUSINESS in the American political system! We can not afford to have any bigots in congress. -Honor Veterans- Excerpt: ""I understand personally the sacrifices of our veterans and I will always ensure that we honor their service and patriotism.""  FACT: Cotton has tried to send us to war with THREE different countries in the last month, including our closest border ally. If Cotton REALLY wanted to honor our veterans he would stop trying to send our families to pointless foreign wars. We need to fix the VA, make sure its properly staffed, make sure veterans get adequate mental health care, and make sure that vets health is always valued above profits.

I am taking time off work, spending every extra dollar we have, and doing everything possible to give Arkansans the best chance possible at having true representation. This is a grass roots campaign which means I‚Äôm not taking corporate donations, fossil fuel donations, billionaire donations, or any other special interest that requires legislative favors down the road. This campaign is fueled by amazing people just like you.  Today I ask you this, how important is it to you and your family to have a representative fighting for you rather than special interest donors? What are you willing to do to gain a voice in the legislative process?  I ask you to consider these questions, and now I must ask for help. Please donate whatever you can. If you can only afford to donate $1.00 that‚Äôs ok! Just setup a $1/mo reoccurring donation. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.  I would also like to add this: Every person that donates to our campaign will receive a list showing where EVERY donated dollar was spent. This is full and complete financial transparency.
