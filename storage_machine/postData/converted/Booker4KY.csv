Charles Booker,,2019-03-30 15:17:58,"I feel it is important to share this with you. On the last legislative day before the veto period, some of you may recall my passionate remarks on the House Floor. It was in response to the continued hate and racism we witnessed through several bills this session, particularly around guns and abortion. In my remarks, I was compelled to repeat the words, “My life matters too.” As I said them, I knew they weren’t my words. Those were the words of people from across Kentucky who are unheard, undervalued, oppressed, and discriminated against. In my spirit, I knew I was speaking for them. Well, in that moment, my mic was cut off and I was gaveled down. There are protocols in the House, and although some are given more leniency than others, I understand that. However, what happened next is something I will never forget. A fellow legislator, a peer and equal to me in the House, got out of his seat, turned around, and at the top of his lungs yelled at me to “Sit Down!” I won’t mention his name now, because he doesn’t matter in this post. That said, you can imagine he hasn’t had to worry about redlining. I didn’t hear him at the time, because I was focused. But, you can clearly hear it in the clip I posted previously. In his voice, you hear anger. I was told his face was red. Other members let me know they could tell he wanted to conclude his scream with a word we all know.... Once we returned Thursday for Sine Die, I approached him to confirm this. Instead of acknowledging his fault, he proudly said he yelled, and continued to (in his mind) educate me on why I needed to sit down. I’ll spare you the rest of the details, because that isn’t the point here (for those who know me, just know that the Hearn in me didn’t stay quiet). The point I want to capture is just how real and present racism and supremacy are in our lives.  In his proud response, I envisioned all the stories my grandad told me about staring down racism and discrimination. I thought about my relatives who were lynched. I thought about people fighting to be heard in places where they aren’t seen as equals. This is a harrowing example of why I am fighting for system level change. The hate we face is real, but it has no chance of winning if we stand together. I just want you to be clear about the space we are in, and the work we have to do. And know this, and I mean know it with everything in you...I will never be silent or sit down when it comes to our fight for justice, equity and true healing for our Commonwealth.  I will never sit down on you. I love you too much for that.

Our local leaders have to lock arms with myself and our other state electeds, and go to Frankfort with a broad proposal on ways Louisville specifically and Kentucky generally can finally make needed tax reforms and generate some sorely needed revenue. As a city, we have to all get around the table, and explore innovative, transparent, cost-saving measures that will not be regressive.

It is not a figment of our imagination, or a notion of the past. It is present, and it continues. Our hope to move past this hate is to not just punish the young man, but to demand change in the systems that justify his narrowed views. Our hope to move past this hate is to not hide behind some sense of shock or disconnection, but to earnestly look at how this treatment is a constant reality for many marginalized communities like my own. Our hope to move past this hate is to elevate and organize behind those like Nathan...folks who stand on the frontlines for themselves and others.
