Charles Booker,,2019-03-30 15:17:58,"I feel it is important to share this with you. On the last legislative day before the veto period, some of you may recall my passionate remarks on the House Floor. It was in response to the continued hate and racism we witnessed through several bills this session, particularly around guns and abortion. In my remarks, I was compelled to repeat the words, ‚ÄúMy life matters too.‚Äù As I said them, I knew they weren‚Äôt my words. Those were the words of people from across Kentucky who are unheard, undervalued, oppressed, and discriminated against. In my spirit, I knew I was speaking for them. Well, in that moment, my mic was cut off and I was gaveled down. There are protocols in the House, and although some are given more leniency than others, I understand that. However, what happened next is something I will never forget. A fellow legislator, a peer and equal to me in the House, got out of his seat, turned around, and at the top of his lungs yelled at me to ‚ÄúSit Down!‚Äù I won‚Äôt mention his name now, because he doesn‚Äôt matter in this post. That said, you can imagine he hasn‚Äôt had to worry about redlining. I didn‚Äôt hear him at the time, because I was focused. But, you can clearly hear it in the clip I posted previously. In his voice, you hear anger. I was told his face was red. Other members let me know they could tell he wanted to conclude his scream with a word we all know.... Once we returned Thursday for Sine Die, I approached him to confirm this. Instead of acknowledging his fault, he proudly said he yelled, and continued to (in his mind) educate me on why I needed to sit down. I‚Äôll spare you the rest of the details, because that isn‚Äôt the point here (for those who know me, just know that the Hearn in me didn‚Äôt stay quiet). The point I want to capture is just how real and present racism and supremacy are in our lives.  In his proud response, I envisioned all the stories my grandad told me about staring down racism and discrimination. I thought about my relatives who were lynched. I thought about people fighting to be heard in places where they aren‚Äôt seen as equals. This is a harrowing example of why I am fighting for system level change. The hate we face is real, but it has no chance of winning if we stand together. I just want you to be clear about the space we are in, and the work we have to do. And know this, and I mean know it with everything in you...I will never be silent or sit down when it comes to our fight for justice, equity and true healing for our Commonwealth.  I will never sit down on you. I love you too much for that.  Let‚Äôs keep bending the arc toward justice.",729,363,1,277,7,14,67,135,546013325908481,Booker4KY,/story.php?story_fbid=546013325908481&id=305380096638473
Charles Booker,,2019-03-21 20:50:41,"As a concerned citizen and resident of the only place I have ever called home, I joined many Louisvillians in watching today‚Äôs Metro Council meeting. It was tough to watch. The vote before them came down to raising insurance premiums or facing devastating cuts to many essential city services. I have many thoughts and concerns about the whole process, but my post right now is to just connect with other residents who are afraid. I understand that fear. I feel it too.  As a young man, this situation is like none I have appreciated in my lifetime. I know the decision was hard on our local leaders. I know most of this is the result of reckless leadership in Frankfort. I also know what it is like to be in Metro City Hall and have to answer to the needs of women, men, children, and vital organizations. This is hard. What we need is a unified front. Our local leaders have to lock arms with myself and our other state electeds, and go to Frankfort with a broad proposal on ways Louisville specifically and Kentucky generally can finally make needed tax reforms and generate some sorely needed revenue. As a city, we have to all get around the table, and explore innovative, transparent, cost-saving measures that will not be regressive. And to be clear, what we don‚Äôt need is for shortsighted leaders in Frankfort to further dismantle our pension system and put more of the burden on our cities. I respect the hard challenges our leaders face, and do not seek to critique now. For our brothers and sisters on the frontlines for our city, for our youth and seniors, for the least among us, we have to find a way to come together and fight through this.
