Ricky Dale Harrington Jr for US Senate,,2020-02-17 23:18:52,"I wanted to share with you one of the main reasons I am running for US Senate.  Last year, a law was passed that makes it difficult for third parties to get on the ballot. The rationale was to make the ballot less cluttered. This is comical when you look at the 2020 ballot. In the Arkansas House of Representatives, 51 seats are UNCONTESTED. That essentially means the candidate has already won.  If not for third party candidates and Independent candidates, 8 of those seats would also be UNCONTESTED. Another 2 seats will be determined by party primary and afterwards, the seat will be UNCONTESTED.  In the Arkansas State Senate, there are 7 UNCONTESTED seats, with 2 others being determined by party primary. My hope is that my campaign will encourage the people of Arkansas to run for office and for other parties to engage in the political process. It is not good for power to be hoarded by one party. Things like the “petition killer bill” are introduced when a party is in power and feels like it can do whatever it pleases.  We must fight to keep our republic healthy. We need diverse ideas. We must find a way to work together and not continue in political tribalism.  So, I say to the people of Arkansas, go and CONTEST those seats! #1stAmendment",29,27,0,1,1,0,0,2,208498140544991,RDH4Senate,/story.php?story_fbid=208498140544991&id=111040616957411

I do not support getting involved in another war that does not involve direct defense of the nation. It is unwise for us to continue intervening in the affairs of sovereign nations. We have spent almost 20 years and $ 2.4 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan  and have not accomplished anything other than continued destabilization of a sovereign nation. We need to stop being the ""world police"". Are we willing to commit more money and the lives of young American men and women on wars that do not bring us to a resolution of offenses against our country. Cool heads must prevail now.

Ricky Dale Harrington Jr for US Senate,,2019-11-23 22:10:47,"Here within the next few days I will be addressing some of the hot button issues we continue to talk about over and over again. For the most part these issues fall right down party lines. As I have said before I have lived in several different countries. A common theme is that they have homogeneous  cultures and have a common origin with their countrymen. We do not have that history in the United States and we usually compete with one another regarding which ideal should be imposed on the on the rest (I oppose this). Now issue 1, healthcare.  In the UK or Scandinavian countries they have a single payer system and for many of those that live in that country it works. We attempted something  like that with the Affordable Care Act. Even after its passage it remained an issue of partisan politics...with the call to repeal and replace by the Republicans.  When the Senate took up a vote to finally  do that, the late Senator  John McCain's health took a turn for the worst. I wonder....in those quiet moments when he was alone with his thoughts...did he think about the scores of Americans who would have to face a life altering illness, and their future was depending on his vote....I wonder what made him choose to not vote along party lines. We live in the most prosperous nation in the world and we are the descendants of men and women who have done great things. Surely we can fix our healthcare system. If we can send robots to Mars, surely we can devise a way for people to receive the medicine they need to survive without going into debt. We need to let people deal with their providers directly and cut out the middleman(they didn't complain about the ACA). We need to stop the FDA issuing government backed monopolies. We need to remove regulations that block a direct pay form of healthcare that may be the answer to slowing the skyrocketing costs of healthcare. Surely we can do it without the government dictating what should be done. #itsyourrepublic",52,42,3,5,0,0,2,9,159200992141373,RDH4Senate,/story.php?story_fbid=159200992141373&id=111040616957411
