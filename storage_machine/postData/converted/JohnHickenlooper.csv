John W. Hickenlooper,,2020-03-07 14:15:45,"Happy caucus day from Team Hick! We're ready to take on Cory Gardner and bring much-needed change to Washington—and that starts with getting on the ballot. At a time when Washington is rife with division, John is the independent problem solver we need in the Senate. Climate change is the greatest threat of our time. John has a plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, bring harmful climate emissions under control, and lead the world on this issue. Read more: https://medium.com/@hickenlooper/john-hickenloopers-plan-to-combat-climate-change-and-build-a-100-clean-economy-2ab33a66366a  Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need to cut costs, get to universal coverage by bringing a public option to the health insurance marketplace, and stop Republicans from gutting protections for preexisting conditions. We must end the stranglehold the special interests have on Washington. John is not taking a dime of corporate PAC money and will work to overturn Citizens United and shine a light on secret political spending in our elections. The gun violence epidemic in America must end. We need to pass common sense background checks on gun purchases, close the terrorist loophole, and keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals, such as domestic abusers.
