Dave Lindstrom,,2020-02-26 12:50:12,"The Schumer-Bollier Democrats predictably ""not letting a crisis go to waste"" are pushing for a new $8.5 billion slush fund with no detailed purpose other than to bloat government and offshore American tax dollars through their favored ""contractors"". As the Trump administration has already stated, funding will be requested as needed to achieve stated goals - currently $2.5 billion to develop a vaccine and work toward containment. Nobody is calling for short-changing the effort, but prudently the administration isn't just borrowing and throwing money at the wall as a ""show"" solution. It may be that over time that much more funding is needed, but by appropriating as the need arises those dollars are far more likely to impact the intended need, rather than flushed down a Democrat rat hole.  Fact is, Dems have opposed President Trump's efforts to close our borders, not only to illegal entry, but to flights and other entry from highly infected nations. The Dem strategy has from the beginning been to cheer the importation of this virus to America's shores as yet another opportunity to politicize tragedy and to manufacture criticism of the president, all the while putting the lives of Americans and their families at risk.

We must stand vigilant in this battle for freedom, for our culture, for defending and valuing life.

Banning travel from Wuhan alone and looking for passengers with inordinate amounts of Kleenex is not going to keep this problem at bay.

Just as we have rightfully set aside this week to remember the more than 50 million unborn lost to abortion and to rally for an awakening to reaffirm a culture of life, we must also remember the powerless who have perished throughout history when cultures displaced God, devalued life and embraced the false idols of government, power, and self.   Anti-Semitism is rooted in corrupt cultures.  It is taking root in America with near daily reports of violence against Jews and their places of worship – yes, right here in America.   Many in our nation’s Congress peddle anti-Semitic rhetoric and advocate anti-Semitic legislation.  Our universities have become breeding grounds for intolerance of all kind, and those perpetrating these acts are often encouraged or are given a free pass by administration.  The corruption at the root of atrocities of the past is on high definition display today in a culture eroded by the socialist Left. We are standing at the precipice of a slippery slope.  If we remain silent, if we sit on the sidelines, tomorrow – in America – all of us not of the Leftist governing “elite” may find ourselves to be the powerless.  That is not the America I want to leave to my children, nor future generations of your family. Now is the time to act, to invite God back into our families, into our communities and into our governance.  And, it’s time to reject the false idols peddled by the socialist Democrats, whose only objective is an intrusive government and a powerless population.

Dave Lindstrom,,2020-01-03 11:42:41,"So, this is the gratitude of Iraq for the U.S. eliminating two leading terrorists, one being Iran's top terrorist general, responsible for ongoing violence against the Iraqi people and U.S. personnel:  Iraq Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi condemned the strike as an “aggression against Iraq” and a “blatant attack on the nation's dignity.” If eliminating leading world terrorists is an attack on Iraq's dignity, then one can only conclude that Iraq is itself an admitted terrorist state or one so weak as to be a willing co-conspirator with the terrorist state of Iran.   Some $3 billion of US taxpayer money is still wasted every year propping up an Iraqi government opposed to U.S. interests.  More than $1 trillion spent to date, plus the immeasurable sacrifice of more than 4,500 Americans dead. Yet, there is still no articulable goal for victory. For too long, our politically correct politicians chose to wage war with American lives and treasure to reach a tenuous truce rather than victory.  But, in the real world, you simply can't nation build out of an inherently immoral, murderous and corrupt culture.   Kudos to President Trump for taking decisive action.  Hopefully, some form of consequences will also follow for those in the Iraqi government that colluded with Iran to perpetuate terrorist attacks on Iraqi soil.  Until those elements are removed from power, Iran will retain a foothold from which to continue its murderous acts of aggression, and victory, if there is one to be had, will remain elusive for even more years to come.",84,68,1,6,1,0,8,9,689972388204912,LindstromforKS,/story.php?story_fbid=689972388204912&id=542530592949093

Their push to dupe Pompeo into the Kansas senate race is nothing more than an attempt to hinder President Trump and to silence Secretary Pompeo on the international stage where he is an effective voice for America First.   As we travel the state, here are ten things real Kansans are telling us about the DC scam to unseat Mike Pompeo from the Trump administration: 1. Leaving the office of Secretary of State would be Pompeo’s third time in three years he left a job entrusted to him by Kansans and the American people to climb the Washington ladder. 2. Pompeo has repeatedly denied his interest in the Kansas U.S. Senate race. Allowing himself to be duped into the race by the establishment puts his own credibility at risk.  3. Kansans don’t want a two year “interim” senator.  Pompeo has made clear his presidential intentions for 2024, meaning that by 2022 his attention will be fully diverted away from Kansas. 4. Kansans don’t want an appointed Democrat senator.  If Gov. Kelly were to win re-election, and Pompeo the presidency, Kelly would appoint a Democrat as his successor. 5. Leaving his current mission unfinished in pursuit of personal political gain would be unconscionable given the dangerous and chaotic world situation. 6. Abandoning President Trump during an election year would send a message of no confidence in the president and his agenda. 7. Abandoning the office of Secretary of State would set back the Trump agenda of America First, handing off the office to a deep state “acting” secretary.  8. Pompeo is the subject of numerous frivolous Democrat lawsuits for which he has federal legal counsel to fight back.  If he leaves office, the legal costs may then be his to bear, whether personally or raising the funds from interested sources, which itself may raise conflicts. 9. Pompeo would have to establish residency in Kansas before filing for senate. He would be house hunting presumably while still purporting to serve as the US Secretary of State. 10. Pompeo is far too valuable in his current position toward advancing the interests of America.  It is in the best interests of Kansas, the nation, and the president for Pompeo to finish the mission he started. It’s time to tune out the party establishment propaganda and manipulation, and let Kansans get on with the business of vetting and electing their own U.S. Senator - and let Secretary Pompeo get back to the business of putting America First!

Careerist politicians often leverage their current office to raise campaign funds to finance pursuing higher office. It's a practice already banned in Kansas at the state level and should be banned at the federal level. 3)    End Suspect PAC Contributions.  Elected officials should be prohibited from accepting PAC contributions from industries with business before the committees upon which the official serves. Committees should operate without a cloud of undue influence. 4)     Eliminate Congressional Pensions.  Senate and House members draw a salary of $174,000 or more than three times the average American's income, and more than enough to save for their retirement.  These pensions cost more than $36 million.  5)    Reduce Salaries for Poor Performance. For every $1 billion in overspending added to the annual deficit, salaries of congress and the president should be reduced by $100.

Our press release detailing Wagle's disturbing pattern of behavior is below. SUSAN WAGLE’S ABUSE OF OFFICE DISQUALIFIES HER CANDIDACY 30 year politician campaigns on tax dollars, raises conflicts of interest in her drive for lobbyist funds TOPEKA – Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle has steamrolled ethical lines in her pursuit to extend her already lengthy political career to the United States Senate. In a period of little more than 30 days, Wagle has given Kansas voters a clear preview of her conduct if allowed to advance to federal office.  “Susan Wagle’s egregious flouting of Kansans ethical expectations of her conduct as a public official disqualifies her candidacy for higher office and demands her immediate withdrawal from the race,” said Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Kansas businessman Dave Lindstrom.  “Such an abuse of the public trust is exactly what we do not need more of in Washington,” Lindstrom continued. Notable ethical lapses have come to light involving Wagle in just the past few weeks: October 10, 2019:  Wagle fires her state senate chief of staff Harrison Hems for his refusal to work for her federal campaign if Wagle used state tax dollars to pay his salary.1  Using state employees to staff her campaign essentially provides Wagle a state taxpayer subsidy for her personal career gain.  “To me it was just this is a federal race. I’m being paid state dollars. In my mind, it was not the best use of taxpayer dollars.” – Harrison Hems2 November 20, 2019:  Wagle announces a country club fundraiser for her federal campaign hosted by seven Topeka lobbyists, among which is her lobbyist son-in-law, as well as one of the state’s most influential political action committees.3 The “hosts” for Wagle’s money event represent numerous interests subject to legislative oversight and influence by Wagle during the remainder of her term as senate president.4   Wagle’s desperate pattern of behavior - conditioning staff employment on support of her campaign, and using state taxpayer dollars to subsidize her campaign - gives rise to questioning whether Wagle’s action on bills during the upcoming state legislative session will be contingent on support for her federal campaign. “While Kansans want the D.C. swamp drained and integrity restored, Susan Wagle has embraced the swamp’s practices as her own,” said Lindstrom. “Wagle not only brought the swamp to Kansas, but it appears likely she would grow the D.C. swamp if given the chance.” ### 1-2 https://sunflowerstatejournal.com/wagles-chief-of-staff-departs-over-disagreement/; 3.

I am honored by the opportunity to address the importance of our freedom to pursue our respective American Dreams, the freedom to chart our own paths, the freedom to share our successes with our families, friends, communities and those we see in need...and the freedom to do so without the interference or ""permission"" of socialists like Chuck Schumer, Barbara Bollier, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  Freedom has never in recent history been at such a tipping point.  Please join with me in this stand for freedom by visiting our website www.lindstromforsenate.com",53,49,0,4,0,0,0,0,648815355653949,LindstromforKS,/story.php?story_fbid=648815355653949&id=542530592949093
Dave Lindstrom,,2019-11-16 09:56:40,"While the Democrats' war on President Trump has produced little to support their accusations, Democrats have proven what Americans have long suspected, unelected bureaucrats have put themselves above the peoples' elected leaders, acting in violation of our constitution and themselves the perpetrators undermining American policy both foreign and domestic.  The constitution is clear that our leaders elected by the people, and only those leaders, possess the legitimate authority to set policy.  For too long presidents and congress have abdicated their responsibilities to an elite star chamber of paper pushers in the swamp, over time creating a shadow government subversive to our constitution and holding a seething contempt for the desires and votes of the ""little"" American people.  This current controversy is not about a phone call, it's about a president seeking to reassert and reclaim the constitutional authority of his office and lead the country based on the platform ratified at the ballot box by the American voters when electing him to the presidency.  This is about restoring the integrity of our constitution.  The American people in less than a year shall make the legitimate determination for the direction our country...Republican or Democrat, we should respect the peoples' choice on Election Day and carryout discussing our policy differences in the confines of true, substantive congressional debate, not through abuse of power, exaggerations, or whole cloth fabrications directed by elitist bureaucrats.   https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/470420-the-president-not-diplomats-sets-official-foreign-policy?#_=_",123,115,0,4,1,0,3,8,646651952536956,LindstromforKS,/story.php?story_fbid=646651952536956&id=542530592949093
Dave Lindstrom,,2019-11-13 12:41:59,"While Congress plays games, they are again punting on their  basic duty - vetting, crafting and passing a full budget.  They instead serve up another ""continuing resolution"" to get through to the end of the Democrats' impeachment show....and Republicans appear on board to co-sign the check.  The result is continuing funding - without oversight, without vetting, without any scrutiny whatsoever - at levels set by the previous budget debacle that added $1 trillion in new debt to our nation's total $23 trillion national debt.  Many of you have heard me speak about the nation being under attack from frivolous ideologies, including socialism.  The attack from within - within the congress and its continuing irresponsibility on fiscal issues - may in fact be the most dangerous of all, as it would seem most in congress wouldn't blink an eye at the price tag of the socialist programs proposed by Barbara Bollier, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  I fear that for plenty of folks on both sides the aisle that signing those checks would be little more than just another day at the office.  This has to stop.  Our founders never envisioned such a large body in unison dismissing its sworn duties.   Congressman Roger Marshall was part of the coalition that advocated to passage the major 2018 spending bill, creating a $1 trillion in new debt. During her 30 years in the Kansas legislature, Susan Wagle presided over billions in new spending that outpaced revenues, triggering a push for multiple tax increases over the years to cover the shorfall.  Both Marshall and Wagle will tout votes for tax cuts, but fail to mention the imbalance created by their enthusiastic votes for massive spending increases.  I believe the tax burden must be reduced to keep our economy strong and to restrain the intrusion of government, but to do so without reducing spending invites a debt fueled fiscal calamity that will inevitably undermine our economy.   I've run a successful business and the books had to balance or the doors would quickly be closed.  I've served on public boards, balancing budgets while in many cases improving critical services.  It can be done - if you actually embrace the duty you have sworn to uphold. We all have a stake in righting this ship.  I ask you to come onboard with me and win this Kansas U.S. Senate as a first step to restoring integrity to Washington, and restoring commonsense to the management of our tax dollars. www.lindstromforsenate.com",48,30,0,0,3,1,14,3,644150539453764,LindstromforKS,/story.php?story_fbid=644150539453764&id=542530592949093

The contrasts could not be clearer.  While my ballot-mates focused on rehashing the past, we focused on our vision for the future.  The challenges we need to tackle are IN FRONT OF US TODAY with sharp consequences for the future - we must push back strongly on the Left's attempt to ""mainstream"" socialism, late term abortion, and yet another expanded ruinous government takeover of healthcare.   In America, every life should be valued; for every dollar you earn, you should have a say in how it is saved, reinvested, or spent - and that includes your tax dollars; every opportunity should be encouraged for those who work hard and have the desire to achieve; and every American should have the choice in their healthcare decisions, their healthcare provider, and  not be confined to an expensive rationed bureaucratic one-size fits all approach financed by a confiscatory tax scheme to push more Americans into government dependence.

Dave Lindstrom,,2019-10-31 00:06:06,"This is what socialism looks like: Barbara Bollier and Elizabeth Warren are fine putting 2 million Americans in the unemployment line and raising taxes $32 trillion on whoever is left hanging onto a job.

I will stand up for patient choice, affordable healthcare reform and oppose ridiculous job killing socialist approaches not only to healthcare, but on all fronts where Bollier and Warren are seeking to rip apart the fabric of our nation.
