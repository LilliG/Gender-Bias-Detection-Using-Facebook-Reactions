Joe Kennedy III,,2020-04-27 10:42:49,"I got into this race because we need stronger leadership in the Senate. And if I thought that six months ago, I think it even more now. Here’s why: This virus has exposed what happens when communities in our Commonwealth are underserved and under-protected. Places like Chelsea and Brockton, disproportionately getting sick, going hungry, losing the people they love. Places like Springfield, forced to fight for their fair share of resources and protection. With everything we are up against – from COVID-19 to the daily wreckage of Donald J. Trump – our people cannot afford absent leadership.  Senator Markey isn’t here enough. He isn’t in Massachusetts enough. And in the months ahead, more than ever, we are going to need a Senator who will be on the ground – with us – as we recover and rebuild. We are also going to need a Senator with the judgment this moment demands. Senator Markey does not have a record of good judgment in times of crisis. In the wake of 9/11, he voted to give us the Iraq War and the Patriot Act. In the midst of a substance use and public health epidemic in the ‘90s, he voted for a Crime Bill that locked people up instead of got them well. At a time when our climate crisis was reaching an apex, when Democrats controlled all three chambers of government, he couldn’t get a bill through. He voted present when President Obama asked Congress for war powers in Syria. He voted present again when Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal to the Senate floor. Now, we face a crisis of unimaginable magnitude. And if you want to know what kind of leadership I will bring to this seat -- in contrast to Senator Markey --  just look at what we have done with our campaigns over the last month. I immediately suspended political activities and shifted to a digital operation focused on one thing: COVID-19. I paused fundraising for myself to raise nearly $100k for frontline organizations driving our response. I reoriented my entire volunteer and organizer network to make wellness calls and check in with seniors across the state. I have dedicated every inch of my time, my resources, and my staff to COVID-19. Senator Markey didn't. That’s the difference between us. As your U.S. Senator I will do better than the political status quo. I will do more than cast good votes or write good bills in Washington. I will show up on the frontlines in Massachusetts. I will fight in the trenches. I will listen, and I will lead.  Because that's what Massachusetts needs to get through this.",12000,10000,7,2300,10,6,9,0,3725158214192381,JoeKennedyIII,/story.php?story_fbid=3725158214192381&id=309993142375589

Our most vulnerable should know they will always be taken care of, and our health care professionals should never, ever doubt that they'll have the essential supplies they need while they're fighting a pandemic. We need Medicare for All for patients, for health care workers, and for the frontline organizations not just during the COVID-19 epidemic, but every day going forward. Together, let's fight like hell for a health care system that is there for all in our moments of deepest need. For a country that sees value in every human life. For a future where each of us can do the one thing that matters most of all — take care of the people we love. Stay well. Stay safe. - Joe",10000,8600,8,1000,35,888,41,0,3704877566220446,JoeKennedyIII,/story.php?story_fbid=3704877566220446&id=309993142375589

Here’s some anecdotal data from Boston, courtesy of @simonfrios: Some heavy news: MGH official tells @WBUR & @elplanetaboston  that 35-40% of COVID patients are Latino — that’s up from ~9% Latino patients before the crisis.

Joe Kennedy III,,2020-03-25 11:27:53,"Hey everyone,  Checking in and making sure you are doing well. We're now under a stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts, so I've been spending my time at home with Lauren, Ellie, and James. While I make a lot of jokes about the chaos (we are literally bouncing off the walls here), I also recognize two things: First, that it's a privilege to be safely home with family right now, to be healthy for the time being, and to have the resources to take care of ourselves. That is not the case for too many among us. If being cooped up is your biggest complaint right now – that is a tremendous gift. And second, I recognize that I am also incredibly lucky not to be braving this alone. Far too many, maybe you or someone you love, are in self-isolation at this moment. That can have profound impacts on mental health and wellbeing. With that in mind, last night I interviewed a friend of mine, Trenni Kusnierek, on how this global epidemic is impacting those with mental or behavioral health conditions. Trenni is a well-known local sports reporter here in Boston and someone who has very bravely and very publicly shared her own struggles with anxiety and depression. Take a minute to watch our conversation. Trenni provided so many helpful and powerful insights: facebook.com/JoeKennedyIII/videos/508385779849126 Our conversation did get me thinking... especially about all those who are alone in their homes right now, and already may have gone a week without seeing another person, only talking to friends and loved ones on the phone – or perhaps not at all. So if you or a loved one is struggling right now, feeling isolated, feeling trapped, having fears about what is going on around us right now – here are some resources from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Take a minute to click through them if you need support. There is some really great advice and a wealth of resources: https://adaa.org/ Take care of yourself. Reach out for help if you need it. Find ways to keep loved ones ""close"" – FaceTime, Zoom, or a good, old-fashioned phone call. I know these are scary and uncertain times. But I also know we'll get through this, together. - Joe",11000,9600,5,1800,5,17,0,0,3606574309384106,JoeKennedyIII,/story.php?story_fbid=3606574309384106&id=309993142375589

Joe Kennedy III,,2020-03-10 15:13:16,"Last Tuesday, I flew home from Washington. The House was in the middle of debate over emergency funding for coronavirus. Republicans were balking at provisions to ensure testing and treatment were affordable for all. They were also threatening to block undocumented Americans from accessing care. I needed to know what was happening at home. So by Wednesday morning, I was sitting at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center with medical experts, community health center staff and public health officials who are preparing for coronavirus on the front lines. Their message was simple: Ensuring vulnerable patients have access to testing and treatment isn’t just the right thing to do for the health of those patients — it’s the right thing to do for the health of us all. It’s the only way we will contain an outbreak. They pointed to the families they serve in East Boston who are disproportionately un- or under-insured. These families are more likely to live in multigenerational homes where grandparents are susceptible to grandchildren carrying the virus (without showing symptoms). This community relies heavily on public transportation, increasing the chances of contracting the virus in larger crowds. They are often hourly workers, gig economy employees and parents working multiple jobs to make ends meet, who are less likely to have paid sick leave or reliable child care. All of these factors create an environment where a patient showing symptoms could wait days, or even weeks, to seek necessary tests and treatment, while potentially exposing loved ones, colleagues, neighbors and strangers to coronavirus. That’s why I called on Congressional leaders to include emergency funding for the community health centers that will provide the first touch for countless patients. That’s why Democrats demanded that tests, treatment and eventual vaccines are available to all who call this nation home — at a cost that will not price a single person out of lifesaving care. A few hours after my meeting in East Boston, the House passed an emergency spending bill. It was a good start. But at every level of government, we have our work cut out of us in the weeks ahead. We must work with insurers to waive any surprise medical bills for quarantines, medical transport and tests. We must guarantee Medicare and Medicaid cover costs. We must ensure outreach to underserved communities is proactive, not reactive, once the first case has been diagnosed. We must offer assistance to the hourly employees and gig economy workers who will bear the most severe economic costs of major disruptions. We must intentionally combat discrimination towards the Asian-American community. We must guarantee that not a single undocumented immigrant is denied care. This virus has become a diagnostic dye across our country, crystallizing all the ways our current system fails And we must use this moment to tackle health care injustice with new energy and new urgency, because we cannot afford to wait. This virus has become a diagnostic dye across our country, crystallizing all the ways our current system fails — the people it doesn’t cover, the access it doesn’t grant, the incentives that reward profit instead of better outcomes. It’s good that Congress is telling insurers to cover telemedicine during this outbreak. They should also cover telemedicine for mental health and addiction crises. It’s great the pharmaceutical industry is racing towards affordable cures and vaccines for coronavirus. They should also race towards a day when diabetes patients don’t have to ration insulin. It’s important that the federal government is trying to protect our stock market with economic stimulus. They should also protect our workers with guaranteed sick days and paid family leave. If we do not use this moment to consider the million ways our current system fails the patients that need it most, then our response will be a band-aid for a bullet wound. Coronavirus has exposed more than our ill-preparedness for public health crises; it has reinforced the deep and dangerous inequities that define American health care today. As we prepare to confront a potential pandemic, it is that inequity that could hamper our response most of all.",12000,11000,5,1600,59,132,30,0,3554078864633651,JoeKennedyIII,/story.php?story_fbid=3554078864633651&id=309993142375589

Joe Kennedy III,,2019-12-30 19:30:44,"It’s unusual to ask for a contribution through a Facebook post. But this is not a usual campaign. It’s about building something better—together. A system that works, a government that listens, a country (and a politics) that we believe in.  And if I’m going to ask you to contribute and be a part of this, I want you to know exactly why: When I was considering running for Senate, I knew it was going to require everything—and then some. I knew that in order to win we needed to build a whole new kind of politics in Massachusetts—a politics that brings everyone in and leaves no one behind. I knew that the role of a Senator is to be present—to show up in the communities in which they represent. To listen. To learn. I knew that if I was going to ask for votes in September of 2020, I needed to be ready to give the people of Massachusetts everything I had. And I know that if we are going to build a better future, I can't do it alone. That's why I'm asking you to join our fight: I'm asking you to make a small contribution to our campaign—any amount helps. Even if it's just $1 or $3. It matters. Every dollar our campaign receives is invested to achieve the goals I laid out when thinking about running for Senate. It's for gas in the car to drive out to Western Mass to listen to voters who, for far too long, haven't heard from their Senator. It's for our organizing staff who are recruiting volunteers and making phone calls to spread our message. It's for lawn signs so that every street you turn down you know there is momentum. It's to ensure that your enthusiasm and support are seen everywhere across the Commonwealth. We're fighting to put the future of our country back in our hands. If we live up to those goals set at the onset of this campaign—and fight to restore the promise of this country—together, we can win this. I hope you'll consider making a contribution to our campaign. With your help, we can truly make an impact. Not only on this race for Senate—but on our politics as a whole. I'm all in. And I hope you are too.",2400,2100,4,253,3,1,7,0,3332665623441644,JoeKennedyIII,/story.php?story_fbid=3332665623441644&id=309993142375589

Then, with less than 24 hours to go, he declared that he’d called the raids off. For now. That wasn’t an act of mercy; Trump’s fickle cruelty is simply a different form of abuse. His threats throw families into chaos, as folks brace for attacks on their children and communities that may or may not come. Now, he’s decided that the raids are back on.
