Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2020-01-12 16:30:22,"WAR: A major threat to our climate. You cannot be fighting for Climate Justice and not be anti-war, but some of my opponents have not made this connection. It should be the job of Congress to AVOID war, not find justifications for going to war. If you say you are for Medicare For All, you should never want to justify war because instead of spending $700 million a day on healthcare, it's spent on bombs and killing innocent people. If you believe in Economic Justice, you cannot justify war that gives billions to war contractors and pays soldiers less than $20k per year for the first two years of service. If you value humanity and diplomacy, you will do everything you can to find peaceful solutions to conflicts, not order unsanctioned assassinations and then try to find justification for the escalation. I am Anti-War because I value humanity and diplomacy because I will fight to save our planet, not blow it up even more, because I support the Green New Deal, because I know that Medicare For All is the solution, and because we should never send someone to sacrifice their lives for less than $20k/year and then throw them to their own devices when or if they come home. If you agree with me, help us reach our goal today of raising another $1,924. Thank you!",14,10,0,4,0,0,0,0,1332374383591245,lorenaforsenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1332374383591245&id=1021086678053352

As many of you know, we‚Äôve been fighting back large scale fracking sites up in north Thornton. The most egregious proposed site is off of 152nd and York, less than 1200 feet from homes and 2,000 feet from silver creek elementary. The operator Great Western had to resubmit their drilling permits to the COGCC, which opened up a Public Comment period, expiring Dec. 21. Thanks to sb181, these wells can now be DENIED. This is where you come in. We are hoping everyone will submit commit regarding why these wells do not make sense so close to homes and schools. You don‚Äôt need to live nearby to submit comments. Not only will these wells be just 1200' from homes in Richfield, which flies in the face of public health and safety as prioritized in SB 181, they are also in a designated Sensitive Wildlife area, a known air-inversion valley, abut a floodplain, and have been controversial since the get go. The air inversion alone means that thousands of homes will be impacted by the pollution and poor air quality caused by these sites.

Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2019-11-27 16:07:20,"On this day last year, I announced my candidacy for U.S. Senate because it was clear to me that our country‚Äôs institutions were eroding and we require a new type of leadership to restore and strengthen them. Leadership that comes from the community, not from behind the curtains where career politicians are groomed.  Since then, it‚Äôs been a whirlwind of a ride, complete with the ups and downs of running a campaign, and especially punctuated with the deepest appreciation and gratitude for all the people I‚Äôve met along this crazy journey.  Looking back, we‚Äôve traveled over 15,000 miles, visited 44 counties, attended 16 forums, and built a grassroots movement consisting of over 11,000 volunteers and supporters!  Along the way, we‚Äôve knocked on hundreds of doors in conjunction with local candidates, been stranded in the mountains, and camped out in the San Luis Valley for an event. None of these things would have been possible without the support from people like you! There are so many of you that I‚Äôm thankful for, I could literally fill several emails with just your names. But there are some people who I would be remiss not to mention because they have been my support line when I needed to vent, my inspiration when I felt down, and my rock when I needed to be grounded. Thank you: Jaimi Flores (my amazing wife), and my parents, Richard and Theresa Garcia. As I look forward to the road ahead, I‚Äôm relieved to know that I‚Äôm not in this alone. This race is bigger than any one person, but together, as allies, we can and will take down the establishment and upend the status quo. But we must keep fighting together, because there‚Äôs still a long way to go and a lot of work that needs to get done before November 2020.  I know so many of you are digging deep and giving what you can and I‚Äôm so grateful for that.

Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2019-11-26 20:37:59,"Tomorrow, 11/27, is my one-year anniversary running for U.S. Senate, and while I will be asking for money soon, we need to talk about the economy first.   In a resource-rich, developed nation like ours, nobody should go broke because they can‚Äôt afford exorbitant medical bills. Nobody should have to work two or three jobs to put food on the table. Current and future generations shouldn‚Äôt automatically be thrown into nothingness due to crippling student debt. No one should be excluded from the American Dream due to their income level, where they are from, or what zip code they live in. America needs a just economy that gives everyone access to opportunities and the ability to thrive, not just survive. That‚Äôll never happen if we don‚Äôt change the very make-up of Congress. For every 13 members of Congress, at least one can be categorized as a one-percenter. The wealthy use their substantial resources to grab the reins of power and use that power to protect their interests and the interests of the wealthy, corporate donors who dictate the legislative agenda. Meanwhile, the gap between the haves and have nots grows exponentially every year, and the middle class is practically non-existent.  This has to change, friends. We must send people to the U.S. Senate who know the struggles of everyday people and who answer to the people. That‚Äôs why we only accept donations from people because a Senator bankrolled by Big Money can‚Äôt truly represent the people and push for people-centered policies like Medicare For all, Tuitions Free Higher Ed, Green New Deal, Consumer protection, all people-centered policies that will help level the playing field.

Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2019-11-25 18:01:28,"We‚Äôre just TWO days away from my one-year anniversary running for U.S. Senate and one of the reasons I am in this fight is education. I come from a family of educators and currently work to expand access to high quality early learning opportunities. We all know the benefit of a strong education system to a country, one that the U.S. has been lacking due to skewed priorities that are not rooted in equity.  Having a child should be a time filled with joy, not stress about the insurmountable debt that will accumulate due to outrageous childcare costs. We can solve this by supporting publicly funded early childhood education, which results in up to a seventeen-fold return on investment, and tuition-free college, which will save our country nearly $14 billion each year, on top of allowing young adults the chance to save for retirement, a house, or to buy an electric vehicle.  Education is so far reaching that it can‚Äôt be covered in a single post. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned teacher‚Äôs pay, school funding mechanisms, the school to prison pipeline, anti-discrimination measures, unintended consequences of charter schools and school choice, and every other area that can be addressed with comprehensive policies. Investing in education is imperative because it‚Äôs an investment in all of our futures. If addressing the climate crisis is your top issue, then we need to be investing in our future scientist and engineers. If a vibrant economy is your greatest concern, then a well prepared workforce that‚Äôs not hampered by debt is our most promising pathway forward.  The only way to build an equitable and robust education system is if we have leaders who will fight for them as if the fate of our country depends on it, because it does.  Invest in my campaign today with a $112.70, $11.27, or whatever contribution you can afford and invest in a leader who will take the fight to the establishment that‚Äôs preventing these changes in the first place.",18,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,1285042498324434,lorenaforsenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1285042498324434&id=1021086678053352

Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2019-11-24 19:19:16,"Three days from today, November 27th, will be one year since I announced my candidacy for U.S. Senate. One of the reasons why is because of the risks we are facing and will continue to face if we don‚Äôt aggressively pursue solutions to the climate crisis. -Climate change disproportionately and negatively impacts communities of color, communities living in poverty, people with disabilities, people living with mental illness, indigenous communities, immigrants, and pregnant women.  -The list of endangered animals grows every year as their ecosystems collapse. The amount of available, ice-free, arable land degrades and decreases every year.  Nations around the globe are seeing more severe seasons and unpredictable weather every year.  -The current administration seems intent on ignoring these facts and insisting on regressive climate policies. And while every other major developed country uses between 55-97% renewable energy, the U.S. only uses 45%. We need a #GreenNewDeal. We need more renewable energy jobs. We need to ramp up efforts for clean transportation, like an intercontinental high-speed train. We need a #JustTransition for the industries and people impacted by switching from the old ways that have imperiled our entire planet to the new methods that will reverse and halt climate change. We need people in Congress who are staunch advocates for a Green New Deal and the policies we need to save our planet. Will you chip in $11.27, or whatever you can, in honor of my one year of candidacy, to help us champion a #GreenNewDeal in the U.S. Senate? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/putpeople1st",8,2,0,6,0,0,0,0,1284132621748755,lorenaforsenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1284132621748755&id=1021086678053352

Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2019-11-23 17:09:43,"Four days from today, November 27th, marks one year since I declared my candidacy for U.S. Senate because I knew that the compounding issues we face today: Climate crisis, healthcare, education, and immigration, need to be addressed with the understanding that each issue area impacts the rest.  I am the daughter of a Mexican immigrant and I have seen how my family is treated. I have seen how other immigrants are treated because of the lies, hate, and bigotry that is spewed by the right. We have a crisis in this country, and while yes, the climate crisis is extremely important, so is the immigration crisis and we must turn this around.  We can change this. There are still thousands of children that have been ripped apart from their families, some then put up for adoption- a form of modern day kidnapping. People are dying in our concentration camps, and yet migrants are still coming here. They are coming because their economies are shattered, they are coming because their governments are corrupt, they are coming because they are experiencing the brunt of the climate crisis we have been major contributors of creating. We have a lot of work to do to prepare for the future impacts of the climate crisis and the immigrants that will need a safe, and welcoming place to call home. I will use my platform to condemn the humanitarian crisis that‚Äôs taking place at our border and in our communities by putting an end to private, for-profit concentration camps that strip people of any due process and dignity, and calling for the abolishment of ICE, and the decriminalization of border crossing.  The next U.S. Senator from Colorado will also have the power to confirm or deny appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, which holds the fate of over 700,000 DACA recipients in their hands. These dreamers and the original dreamers, their parents and family members, are our friends, neighbors, doctors, educators, community leaders and so much more. I will use my platform to demand protections for DACA recipients and all of the immigrant community, that will include a pathway to citizenship.  We need to protect the immigrant communities that make up our workforce, teach our next generations, provide medical support to our families and more. We need a leader who is ready to take on this fight and ensure that any and every immigration policy brought forward is rooted in dignity, respect, and opportunity.

Endorsements are an important aspect to running a campaign, but they don‚Äôt dictate who will be our next nominee, nor who is the greatest champion for any single issue. You make that determination.  So I invite you to make your own informed decision about who has the most robust platform for fighting the climate crisis by comparing my platform at https://lorenaforsenate.com/issues/ with the other candidates in this race.  Furthermore, since this race isn‚Äôt about me, rather it‚Äôs about all of us, I welcome any and all feedback for how I can strengthen my stance on environmental issues and ensure that we are addressing every vulnerable aspect, not just those that make good progressive talking points. Taking on the special interest groups that actively want to defeat any environmental measure is going to require a level of voter engagement we‚Äôve never seen before.  Please engage with me so we can make this issue the priority it deserves to be, backed by a leader committed to addressing the climate crisis with the urgency and perseverance that will be required to come out on top.",41,28,0,13,0,0,0,2,1278356188993065,lorenaforsenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1278356188993065&id=1021086678053352

Lorena Garcia For Senate,,2019-11-17 12:15:07,"Repost from Patricia Miller: The 3-year-old girl traveled for weeks cradled in her father's arms, as he set out to seek asylum in the United States. Now she won't even look at him. After being forcibly separated at the border by government officials, sexually abused in U.S. foster care and deported, the once bright and beaming girl arrived back in Honduras withdrawn, anxious and angry, convinced her father abandoned her. He fears their bond is forever broken. ""I think about this trauma staying with her too, because the trauma has remained with me and still hasn't faded,"" he said, days after their reunion. This month new government data shows the little girl is one of an unprecedented 69,550 migrant children held in U.S. government custody over the past year, enough infants, toddlers, kids and teens to overflow the typical NFL stadium. That's more kids detained away from their parents than any other country, according to United Nations researchers. And it's happening even though the U.S. government has acknowledged that being held in detention can be traumatic for children, putting them at risk of long-term physical and emotional damage.",45,5,0,0,0,5,35,2,1277308165764534,lorenaforsenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1277308165764534&id=1021086678053352

"Lorena Garcia For Senate,COS Womxn‚Äôs March",COS Womxn‚Äôs March,2019-01-18 18:01:02,"Looking forward to the Womxn‚Äôs day marches tomorrow! I am thrilled to speak at the Colorado Springs march!Meet Lorena Garcia, she has been supporting vulnerable communities throughout Colorado for more than a decade, by developing and executing meaningful and effective life changing programs. Dedicated to serving nonprofit organizations her entire career, Garcia works tirelessly to build up the dignity of marginalized communities by bringing to them programs that drive confidence and success. Touching the lives of people both Colorado and around the globe, Garcia also supports communities in Nepal and Nicaragua, helping them create self-sufficient, circular economies that allow them to thrive in their isolated areas. The services Garcia brings to these communities include education, economic, and health and nutritional programming. As a candidate for U.S. Senate, Garcia believes that it is time for a new voice in the U.S. Senate. We are at a crossroads in our history where we can no longer accept the status quo, but must take courageous action to fix our broken government systems. Garcia is running because she believes the path to change must begin with innovative leaders who will work as tirelessly as she has for the interests of every Coloradan, not for political aspiration or special interest funding. She is dedicated to creating a country where thriving means every individual has access to  economic opportunity, no matter where one lives, family origins, gender or race.   Garcia stands behind her belief that we can have a strong educational system that begins  with early childhood education for all, to help prepare our next generations to successfully face  the challenges we leave for them. It must start with leaders who value all people and invests in its education and health. These two commitments alone help will ensure that economic status is no longer predicated on access to healthcare or higher education. A belief that we can pass laws that protect the planet while also maintaining the dignity and economic impact for those who work in oil and gas industry at the same time.   As a veteran organizer, women‚Äôs rights activist and nonprofit administrator who has worked in the interest of the public good throughout her career, Garcia has led important fights for family sustaining economic policies, for adequate funding for public transportation, civil rights protections to protect women‚Äôs reproductive independence, at the State Capitol and at the ballot box.   As a  7th generation Coloradan on her  father‚Äôs side and first generation on her  mother‚Äôs side, Garcia‚Äôs family background mirrors many families in Colorado and across the country. Her commitment to the well-being of families can be tied back to her own as the youngest of six siblings  and aunt of 16 nieces and nephews. She has been married to Jaimi, her wife for seven years. Garcia has a Bachelor‚Äôs in film studies from CU Boulder and MBA from the George Washington University. Join Lorena at The COS Womxn‚Äôs Afterparty Showcase at 3:30 PM at 730 N.
