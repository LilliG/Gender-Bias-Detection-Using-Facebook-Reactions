But I have a decent you-know-what detector. #SteveDaines had a dedicated Forest Service employee in Montana suspended, career ruined, for defending access to public lands. Now, after Pat Bellinghausen, of #BillingsGazette, led the harshest critique of Daines, including describing him as “more sycophant than senator” and, most recently, taking him to the woodshed for failing to show independence from the Executive Branch during the impeachment trial, Pat Bellinghausen has been fired. If there is a solid explanation, please share (I do not want to be conspiratorial).  However, I have yet to find one.  I do not regard “reorganization” as an adequate explanation, given the context. What we do know is that Daines is not an ethical man, has a history of vindictive retribution, just like the president, and we are in the middle of an election year of which Daines is a major part. The truest tell will be if the Billings Gazette ceases its real criticism of Daines moving forward.  Until then, we need better answers. #mtpol #mtsen #mtnews #stevebullock #jontester #nytimes #wapo",30,26,0,2,0,0,2,4,646157086145255,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=646157086145255&id=445262262901406

"John Mues for Montana,John Mues",John Mues,2020-02-25 23:51:28,"Quality summary from #montanafreepress. BOZEMAN — The Gallatin County Democrats hosted a Senate candidate forum at Bozeman’s Emerson Center for the Arts & Culture Feb. 21. Candidate John Mues used the occasion to suggest that the nomination of any of his fellow primary candidates to the general election ballot would give incumbent Republican Steve Daines a “free pass” to re-election.  The hardball assessment stood out in the context of an event that was less a proper debate than an introduction to the candidates, and an opportunity for the Gallatin County Democratic Central Committee to solicit money to support the slate.  Mues was the only one of the five Democrats angling to challenge Daines who put forward an aggressive case for himself, specifically, as the candidate best positioned by experience and expertise to unseat the incumbent, whom several of the evening’s candidates referred to as an “existential threat.”  Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins made the same claim to electability, but without much effort to make a specific case. Bozeman-based State Department veteran and health-and-economic-development nonprofit founder Cora Neumann presented a strong case for her expertise in health care policy, and was laser-focused on the importance of “flipping the Senate.” Bozeman’s Michael Knoles proved himself the most systemically radical and emotionally excitable of the contenders, making a closing-statement claim that “we are a parasite on this earth and we are destroying it because we do not understand the consequences of our actions.” Bozeman fishing guide Josh Seckinger, who’d entered the race just two days earlier, rarely used the entirety of his allotted one minute for answers, and promised to depart in two days to visit all of Montana’s 56 counties and win the nomination “with gas and coffee and cheap motel rooms.” He made a solid case that he’s an excellent guy to share a boat with.  Mues’ effort to transcend the crowded field risked running afoul of the all-in-this-together vibe of an assembly that reserved its most approving responses for attacks on Daines and Republican U.S. House Rep.-turned-gubernatorial candidate Greg Gianforte. Half a dozen times, Mues, a navy veteran, former teacher, rancher, and energy-sector engineer who lives in Loma, stated some variant of the assertion that he was “the only candidate on the stage” with the right combination of small-town pedigree, agricultural know-how, military credentials, and business acumen to take down Daines. Neumann’s occasional side-eye in response to the claims was the only sign that any of the other four candidates might challenge him directly on that.  #mtpol ",18,16,1,1,0,0,0,1,645787949515502,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=645787949515502&id=445262262901406

Frankly, he reported the policy differences more accurately than the big newspapers.  Also, per #TheMontanaPost: “John Mues was the most substantive candidate most of the night, offering specific policy answers to almost all of the questions posed. He demonstrated a natural command of the stage, but perhaps suffered more than any other candidate due to the last-minute decision to shorten answers from 90 seconds to 60. And while I think it’s certainly part of his message for the campaign, his closing statement was a misstep: his suggestion that he was the only candidate who could win against Senator Daines came across quite harshly and elicited an audible negative reaction from the crowd.” #mtpol #mtsen #mtnews",11,10,0,1,0,0,0,1,644848536276110,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=644848536276110&id=445262262901406

He also had positions that indicated original and independent thought.  His background is the best ""fit"" with Montana and the needs of our citizens.  He did not pander to the audience, but was an authentic, straight-shooter. Cora Neumann, the media's apparent favorite, gave good, rehearsed responses to a few questions. But she lacked the poise I had expected her to have, based on how she's been presented to us.   Wilmot Collins had a couple flashes of brilliance, but was very uneven. Mike Knoles was a bit incoherent. Josh S was an amiable fishing guide, who would be fun to know. An interesting display The clear message:  John Mues - and only John Mues - can beat the empty suit backbencher who, as Wilmot says, is not a senator but has become part of the executive branch, leaving Montana with only one real senator.

His vote merely means he won’t, in the meantime, be invited to CPAC, or to GOP poker nights. He voted as anyone should have.  And he voted as one who still eyes the presidency.  On the fringes of Trump’s Republican Party, why wouldn’t Romney bet on the Trumpian fever eventually breaking, and to decisively and early differentiate himself from that swamp? I remain infinitely thankful Obama defeated Romney, who remains exactly what America does not need.  In an age of unprecedented, democracy-threatening economic inequality, Romney remains an oligarch, for oligarchs.   But, in 2020, a hero relative to his Republican counterparts.

I’d like, preemptively, to give a rebuttal as a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate from Montana. You may hear that the state of the union is strong. - But did you know that we are living in an age of unprecedented wealth and income inequality, a detriment to our democracy? - Did you know that the “American Dream”, objectively, is more alive and vibrant in other advanced nations than America? - Did you know that deaths of despair (suicide, drug overdoses) have never been higher? - Did you know that our trade deficit has gotten bigger, not smaller? - Did you know that hyper-partisanship has never been greater, and that adherence to the Constitution has never been lower? - Did you know that clean water and air, under this Administration, have never been in greater doubt? - Did you know that basic American infrastructure is falling apart at the seams, and needs real investment? You may hear that the unemployment rate is at a low 3.5%.   - But did you know that the unemployment rate, during this Administration, has only gone down by 1.3% (from an already low 4.8%)?   - Did you know that, in the prior Administration (under a Democrat), the unemployment rate went down by 5.4% (from 10.2%)?   - Did you know that jobs without any benefits count the same as jobs with benefits, and that the percentage of jobs without any benefits is rapidly rising? - Did you know that the Administration supports curtailing basic food assistance for low-income individuals? - Did you know that farm bankruptcies have spiked? You may hear that the stock market is at an all-time high.   - But did you know that part of that boost is because of corporate stock buybacks and dividend yield increases that artificially prop up share prices?   - Did you know that, in order to drive the market upward, the U.S. government just ran a record $1 Trillion deficit, burdening future generations of Americans?   - Did you know that the top 10% wealthiest in America own 84% of the stock market? - Did you know that half of all Americans own no stock at all, in any form? - Did you know that foreign investors own 20% of the U.S. stock market? You may hear that ISIS has been defeated in Iraq and Syria and the terrorist al-Baghdadi was killed. - But did you know that the successful war against ISIS was started under the prior Administration (specifically, with the campaign in Mosul)? - Did you know that President Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies in northern Syria, allowing 1,000 ISIS fighters to escape back into the population? - Did you know that the Administration has curried favor with and protected Mohammad Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, which supplied 15 of 19 9/11 hijackers and continues, however indirectly, to fund radical madrassas throughout the world? You may hear that the U.S. is respected in the world, again. - But did you know that our democratic allies have never trusted America less, and that the world believes America is more a threat to peace than China or Russia? - Did you know that American policy towards North Atlantic Treaty Organization is as Russia would like it to be?   - Did you know that the Administration has a cozier relationship with authoritarian regimes like Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia than with many nations that value freedom? - Did you know that America has refused to lead by pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords and Iran Nuclear Deal? - Did you know that the Administration has given legitimacy to North Korea, which represses its people and has nuclear ballistic missiles? You may hear that minorities and women are doing wonderful. - But did you know that the Administration supports taking away Choice from women? - Did you know that the Administration supports separating children from their mothers at the southern border? - Did you know that the Administration supports voter suppression?  You may hear about Space Force. - But did you know that America, already, spends more on its military than the budgets of the next ten largest militaries in the world, combined?

But Trump's defense of his innocence is an even greater threat to America.  Alan Dershowitz, Trump's attorney, has made the general argument before the U.S. Senate:  because a U.S. president deems it so, it is.   Should this defense not be eviscerated by Democrat and Republican U.S. senators alike - even if the U.S. Senate as a whole votes not to remove the president from office - then the notion of presidential accountability, enshrined in our Constitution and a tenet of our democracy, will be rendered quaint and obsolete.

Not only does Mues have deep knowledge of current policy and political challenges, he also provided thoughtful replies to the difficult questions I asked him.  When asked what made him think he deserved our vote, John acknowledged the problem of privilege, then told us that he came from a humble background.  He added that after he was honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy, he chose to teach high school English and math for two years of differentiated service to country on the Ft. Belknap Indian Reservation where he helped build programs that encourage student success and recognition in one of Montana’s highest needs schools. As John spoke about his time teaching it became apparent that he shares as much passion for teaching and serving kids in Montana as he does for serving the country as an active duty U.S. Naval Academy-commissioned nuclear submarine officer, where John was four times deployed overseas. Due to his service to both county and to our youth, John Mues also possesses a depth of diversity that is deepened by his experience growing up and living in many parts of Montana.  As well, he has worked as a senior engineer in the energy sector and earned a MBA from the London Business School.  Few people I have met can claim such a depth of experience and expertise with such a diverse resume.  His campaign style is reaching out to his constituent base so that he can listen and learn what they would like to see from him. In fact, he persisted in his efforts in the midst of some incredible challenges. The fact that John was able to prioritize his newborn son, Leo and his wife, Claudia, when Leo was born prematurely is perhaps, what impresses me most about John.

Mandela, who had led South Africa to overcome apartheid, had been uplifted, as a lawyer, jailed activist, and South Africa's President, by the man we celebrate today, Martin Luther King, Jr.  (MLK, as well, had publicly called for the U.S. and Europe to boycott South Africa's apartheid state, a policy implemented two decades later.) When Mandela addressed a joint session of U.S. Congress, he said, channeling MLK, ""Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty we are free at last.""  #mtpol #mtsen #mtnews",18,14,0,4,0,0,0,0,621212381973059,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=621212381973059&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2020-01-06 14:52:48,"My (longish) response to a Republican who thought I was anti-business: ""I appreciate your comments, and here are mine: I'm not just a military veteran 4x deployed and Montana teacher in an underserved community. I've been in the business sector for over a decade and understand those in the business world. I also have a Master in Business Administration, where I studied Economics, from the London Business School, arguably the world's top business school. Though a 4th generation Montanan, I've traveled to over 60 countries and understand international business. I've worked world-class business projects overseas. For example, I was a part of the largest foreign direct investment business project in a major nation. I've also provided pro bono business consulting - at no charge - to small businesses. I also grasp the macroeconomics that can put America at a disadvantage compared to global rivals, and have sound, implementable ideas on things we can do to regain our national edge. Unlike Senator Daines, I grew up humbly as a kid in small Montana towns - Daines was born into wealth and grew up sheltered in a high-end neighborhood of Bozeman (no offense if you're from Bozeman and grew up wealthy, too). I should also add that, unlike Daines, my father never assisted me in getting a job. Most jobs Daines has had, including the one by which he made his money, were handed to him by his father - fact. I'm the only candidate who has lived in RURAL Montana. I've lived in Eastern, Central, and Western Montana, and love all parts of Montana. I've also owned a 1,500 acre Montana cattle ranch for nearly a decade, and am the only candidate with Agricultural experience. I am focused on JOB CREATION, and understand how critical that is. In addition to my business background, I'm an engineer. I've been wearing a hard hat on industrial job sites in Montana, the U.S., and internationally for over a decade. I'm, lastly, the only Democrat in the MT U.S. Senate primary race with real business experience.

John Mues for Montana,,2020-01-02 12:50:50,"Thank you Billings Gazette for publishing my Op-Ed on Food Insecurity and the Trump/Daines/Gianforte/GOP announced cuts in SNAP (food assistance) between Thanksgiving and Christmas.   For those who don't have access, text below: OP-ED:   WHY I SUPPORT FOOD SECURITY FOR ALL AMERICANS At the U.S. Naval Academy, as a plebe, our squad leader, a future Navy SEAL, asked our table, “Who here believes in the concept of food stamps?”  Of ten plebes, each of us seated on the front two inches of our seats, our backs ramrod straight and our chins and necks conjoined into what is referred to as a “brace”, only an Irish-Catholic New Yorker and I put out our “paws”, signaling that we did.  I was asked how I could defend that position.  I replied, “Sir, because without food stamps as a kid growing up in Montana, I probably wouldn’t be here at Annapolis.”  Food assistance programs – from food stamps to free school lunches - enabled my talent to become realized, facilitated, as well, by excellent Montana public school teachers. On 04 Dec, 2019, with Thanksgiving just past and Christmas approaching, the Trump Administration passed a rule via the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), ostensibly supported by U.S. Senator Daines and U.S. Representative Gianforte, that will deepen cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – our food stamp program - worsening hunger and food insecurity in Montana and throughout America.  Based on analysis, the cuts – however couched in base-appealing, partisan rhetoric – will impact nearly 50,000 Montanans receiving SNAP and 20% of SNAP recipients nationally.   President Trump, Senator Daines, and Representative Gianforte – all of whom grew up wealthy and privileged – have never known the threat of hunger.  And that’s ok – in fact, that’s the way we’d like it to be for everyone.  Yet, one needn’t personally experience food insecurity to grasp the morality - including longstanding Christian morality - and talent unlocking mechanism of government food assistance.  Either out of a sense of decency or a belief that society runs best when talent is not suppressed by hunger, countless Americans – rich and poor alike – support government programs, free of the constant threat of budgetary cuts, that tackle food insecurity.  Why then, during the holiday season, would such a rule be proposed that will devastate the lives of so many?   It’s important to understand that, in 2017, Senator Daines and Representative Gianforte voted for the Trump tax bill that gave massive tax breaks to America’s wealthiest families and powerful multinational corporations.  This resulted in a record $1 Trillion annual federal deficit and is projected to add trillions more to an already formidable $23 trillion federal debt.  Moreover - contrary to widespread belief - the number of jobs created under Trump has lagged that added during the Obama administration (given the same amount of time), many must work multiple jobs just to put food on the table, and economic inequality is soaring.  In addition, publicly-traded corporations used most of the tax cut largess to buy back their own stock or increase their dividends, rather than invest in capital projects and hiring, resulting in an artificial boost to the U.S. stock market, mostly benefiting the ultra-wealthy, including foreign investors. I believe in tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses.  But the 2017 tax bill was an unpatriotic act, burdening us and countless future generations with a runaway federal debt without improving our nation. President Trump, Senator Daines, and Representative Gianforte, among others, convinced Americans that the 2017 tax bill would result in lower federal deficits and big corporate investments in people.  Yet, it was merely a once-in-a-lifetime cash grab by America’s wealthiest families and multinational corporations.   Now, they are scrambling to make cuts everywhere, including to SNAP right before Christmas, in order to appease their base and cover their fiscally negligent tracks before election day. ***** John Mues is a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-12-24 14:31:15,"Really appreciate my London Business School mates for today's plug.  See below: Cheers and Happy Holidays, Everyone! We'd like to bring to the London Business School community's attention the United States Senate candidacy of John Mues (MBA ’13), one of our own. He is running as a Democrat out of his home state of Montana - a state with a long history of electing Democrats. To our knowledge, this marks the first time an LBS alum has run for a U.S. Senate seat!  secure.actblue.com/donate/jm4s The 100 members of the U.S. Senate have considerable influence on much that impacts not only America but all of us, internationally. Climate change, macroeconomic policy, trade agreements, security agreements, and the rights of women, LGBTQ, and others are issues that bind us together. Knowing John, we are confident he'd make an excellent addition to the U.S. Senate, bolstered by his extensive global experiences, including those acquired at LBS.  John’s opponent, the Republican incumbent U.S. Senator, Steve Daines, denies the existence of climate change, supports spurious trade wars, has endorsed the pull-out of the U.S. from the Iranian Nuclear Deal, Paris Climate Accords, and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Agreement, and opposes equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community, among other questionable positions.  He has also publicly referred to a variety of his political opponents in the U.S. as “Anti-American”, “Anti-Semitic”, and “Terrorist” (source: Twitter and Fox News).  Montana is infinitely winnable.  Currently, 50% of higher office holders in Montana are Democrats.  A Democrat has held the Montana Governor’s seat for the entirety of the 21st century.  And, throughout the last half century, at least one of the two U.S. Senators in Montana has been a Democrat. (John is actually trying to take back a seat held, up until 2014, by a Democrat.) If you are a U.S. permanent resident or U.S. citizen, then we'd strongly encourage you to contribute generously to his campaign ($2,800/individual or $5,600/household is the max limit, or what works within your budget; even small money contributions appreciated) - and ideally before the end of December (a major filing date). And if you're not a U.S. citizen/permanent resident, consider forwarding this info on to those in your network who are. Money, unfortunately, remains an important factor in electoral success! The donation link is here: secure.actblue.com/donate/jm4s Please see a summary of John's background: - Education: U.S. Naval Academy (B.S. English, honors), Naval Nuclear Power Program (U.S. Dept. of Energy-certified Nuclear Engineer), Montana State University's Northern Plains Transition to Teaching Program (Teaching Certificate), and London Business School (MBA) - Military (1 of every 10 Montanans is a Military Veteran, like John): naval officer 4x deployed overseas, 2x permanently assigned overseas, and 20+ Top Secret/SCI missions conducted, with qualifications as a nuclear submarine warfare office, military parachutist, and Navy SCUBA diver - Volunteerism: For two years, through the Troops-to-Teachers Program, served as the high school math and English teacher in a federally designated low-income school district in Montana, on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation - Business: Senior Engineer in energy sector working combination of renewable and traditional energy projects world-wide - Agriculture: Owned and managed 1,500 acre cattle ranch and farm in north central Montana for nearly a decade - Has deep Montana roots (4th generation), and grew up in Helena, Deer Lodge, and Wolf Point, Montana - International Experience:  Traveled to over 60 countries, particularly enjoys travel in emerging countries, and worked for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), coordinating with its 30+ member and Partnership for Peace countries secure.actblue.com/donate/jm4s Thank you ALL, and happiest of holidays!

John Mues for Montana,,2019-12-17 14:19:52,"I’m a proud lifelong Montana Democrat. What would #SteveDaines call himself?  A Republican? Words matter a great deal, and the word Republican carries weight and gravitas in our nation and around the world.  It represents, in large part, the public lands contributions of Theodore Roosevelt, the bravery - as a WWII general and supporter of tax fairness - of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the lack of acquiescence towards foreign tyranny - specifically, the USSR - of Ronald Reagan.   None of these prominent Republicans in American history, I’m convinced, would see Senator Daines as a Republican, as they defined the term.  One who endorses a sworn enemy of public lands, William Pendley, to lead the BLM.  One who acts more as a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia’s Mohammad Bin Salman and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, among other dictators, than a US Senator fighting for Montanans and our nation.  One who stays silent - either out of cowardice or ideological alignment - as our president mocks the disabled and lays siege to the free press, Gold Star families (who have lost a son or daughter in battle), Prisoners of War, our NATO allies, our Kurdish allies, and even a sixteen year old climate activist with Aspergers (her “superpower”).  Such a person is not a Republican, as historically described, but one who has co-opted that name and brand to further an agenda that, under any less a banner, would draw immediate revulsion and rejection. In many ways, the historical Republican Party - yes, because of its failed domestic policies that have resulted in a middle class-less society of have’s and have not’s and the diminishment of the American Dream and socioeconomic mobility in the U.S., but also because it (incorrectly) assessed the bigotry, racism, and xenophobia in its ranks - manifested in White Nationalism, Anti-government Militias, Christian Fundamentalism, and Neo-Nazism - as more useful than not, and containable - has metamorphosed into what it once willingly hosted. Flipping the US Senate and White House to Blue in 2020 is not merely important.  It is our duty as Americans, independent of political affiliation.  #mtpol https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/opinion/lincoln-project.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share",48,42,0,6,0,0,0,4,591475861613378,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=591475861613378&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2019-12-14 15:04:35,"People really appreciate it when I’m straightforward about U.S. Senator Daines’ tragic record.  Now, I’m going to apply a bit of scrutiny to ourselves, as Democrats, this 2020 US Senate primary election season.  Because we have a real opportunity to beat Senator Daines, contribute to flipping the US Senate, and repair and rebuild our nation, if we so choose. I.  1 of every 10 Montanans is a veteran. Should I be fortunate enough to win the MT Democratic primary on 02 June 2020, it will mark the first time in many decades that Montanans in a general election will have the opportunity to vote for a Democrat running for federal office who has served his country in uniform in a combat zone.  (In my case, 4x deployed overseas and 2x permanently stationed overseas.)  It will also mark the first time that an honors service academy graduate has run for federal office as a Democrat in MT. II.  Montana is full of small business owners, whom vote - just not for Democrats, usually. I am the only candidate in the MT Democratic U.S. Senate primary with business experience, and the only, of any party, self-made in the private sector (unless you consider #stevedaines, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, “self-made”).  I also have a MBA with an Econ focus from the London Business School in the United Kingdom. III.  Montana is full of farmers and ranchers. I’m the only candidate, of either party, to have MT agricultural experience, having owned a 1,500 cattle ranch and farm in MT for nearly a decade. IV.  Montana has a large older citizen population. In addition to supporting Medicare and Social Security, I’m the only candidate, of any party, to have provided pro bono consulting to a startup nonprofit dedicated to reducing senior loneliness and depression and re-engaging seniors with their communities.  It is now a going concern organization. V.  Montana is a Labor rich state.   My parents were members of MT labor unions.  I’m a proud MFPE member.  I’m the only candidate in the Democratic US Senate primary who can win back the union members Democrats have lost to Trumpism - and will lose again without a compelling candidate. VI.  Public education is vitally important in MT (and, everywhere else). I’m the only candidate, of either party, to have served as a MT public school teacher. VII.  Montana is home to many sovereign tribal nations with rich cultures. I’m the only candidate, of any party, to have not only grown up, in part, on a MT tribal nation, but to have lived and worked full-time on a MT tribal nation. VIII.  Climate change is an existential issue for humanity. I’m the only candidate, of any party, to have directly worked on clean, renewable energy projects, tackling climate change.  Talk only goes so far. IX.  Being familiar with Montana is important. I’m the only candidate, of either party, to have lived in rural MT (as well as in its major towns), and the only to have lived in Eastern, Central, and Western Montana. X.  Understanding national security is essential to being a US Senator, though too few are so versed. I’m the only candidate, of either party, to have been entrusted with a Top Secret/SCI clearance and to have worked critical national security issues requiring close collaboration with the CIA and SOCOM.  I also worked at NATO, coordinating with countless allied and semi-allied nations. We have the opportunity to upend the conventional logic regarding the US Senate race in MT.  The remaining question, to be determined 02 June 2020, is do we truly want to beat Daines and solve the major challenges facing our Montana communities, nation, and planet?   Again, people appreciate me being straightforward about Daines.  But to win and turn around our country, we must be, as well, as Democrats, honest with ourselves. #mtpol",50,41,0,9,0,0,0,4,588831108544520,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=588831108544520&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2019-12-03 20:16:06,"Challenges are worth taking on, especially when the stakes for our state, country, and planet are so consequential. Beating Senator Daines (R) on 03 November 2020 is one of them.  Here are some other challenges I've faced in my lifetime: - Told at a young age that college for someone in my shoes in Montana - broken family, requiring free school lunches, family sometimes on government food assistance - was unlikely.  Ultimately, congressionally nominated to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD, from which I graduated with academic honors while lettering in Division I sports. - Did well at a small tennis tournament in MT despite not being able to afford a membership to an indoor tennis facility.  Then told that my performance was an anomaly, that it was impossible for me to keep that up.  Followed that up by winning 5 consecutive Montana State Junior Tennis Championships, attaining one of the highest national rankings of any junior tennis player in MT history, and playing #1 for a Division I tennis team as a freshman. - Walked into the state MathCounts championship in Butte, alongside three other students from Deer Lodge.  Though we were facing the best of the best math students from Missoula, Great Falls, Billings, Bozeman, and other towns, our four-person math team from Deer Lodge won the state-wide math championship. - Broke my hand at the very outset of Plebe Summer (boot camp) at the U.S. Naval Academy.  Was advised to drop out and re-apply as impossible to complete Plebe Summer with broken hand.  Instead, had a full arm cast put on, and successfully completed Plebe Summer.  By end of it, could do 60 left-handed push-ups. - Admitted to the post-graduate Naval Nuclear Power Program (Master equivalency in Nuclear Engineering) despite being an English major.  Watched as top engineers, scientists, and mathematicians - including a Marshall Scholar - washed out of the demanding program.  Not only did I graduate, but I then became a U.S. Department of Energy-certified nuclear engineer officer, scoring near the top of my year-group on the capstone Prospective Nuclear Engineer Officer exam.   - Told by the CIA that a series of sensitive missions had been suspended because the White House had ordered all WMD resources to be focused on finding WMD in Iraq, post-invasion.  I made the case that the suspended missions were just as important and needed to be turned back on.  In turn, our RFI was approved.  Invariably, no WMD was found in Iraq, but an illicit operational WMD program was discovered with the resumed missions, then dismantled. - In Middle East on deployment, after completing a SCUBA security swim of our submarine, received flash message traffic to get our boat underway ASAP.  Led an uber-talented crew in performing, arguably, the first ever emergency reactor startup in the Persian Gulf, establishing propulsion.  Then, once safely to sea, discovered that the USS Cole had been bombed by Al Qaida, claiming the lives of seventeen American sailors.  For weeks on end, at battlestations, with missiles spun up, awaited permission to strike back.   - Turkey's Erdogan, at the last second, rescinded missile overflight permission for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  We as a team worked non-stop to re-route the largest task force of nuclear submarines ever assembled to another theater in order to successfully continue the mission.   - NATO's Steadfast Jackpot exercise, one of the most consequential post-Cold War post-command exercises ever, was woefully behind schedule.  I was empowered to take charge and quickly got the exercise back on track, and supervised its flawless execution.   - Navy's multi-$B investments in retrofitting SSBN's for SEAL use began to look dubious.  I was assigned as a SEAL-Submarine liaison officer, helped plan the first American SEAL-Submarine real world missions, and successfully recommended critical changes to national policy.  Post-facto, submarine intel viewed preferably by the naval special warfare (SEAL) community. - Joined Hays-Lodgepole High School on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation as the math and English teacher.  Told by too many that the best we could hope for as educators on the reservation was to comfort our students, the majority of whom came from tough backgrounds.  Instead, I built the school's computer lab, established a summer school program, forged scholarships for the top students and a Most Improved Student Award for the students most struggling, incorporated Native American literature and poetry in the westernized curriculum, and organized fields trips reinforcing my students' indigenous culture.  Today, I'm honored to have contributed, however slightly, to the success of so many of my former students.   - In business sector, assigned to the largest foreign direct investment project in Russia, which was a candidate, if it underperformed, for Russian nationalization.  Team was tasked with performing an engineering feat that had no precedent, anywhere, with $B's at stake.  Led design and supervised successful execution, removing nationalization risk.       - Provided pro bono consulting to a startup nonprofit focused on reducing senior citizen loneliness.  Many thought the idea would not gain traction.  Today, several years later, it is a going concern organization helping thousands of seniors.   - Purchased a water-scarce 1,500 acre cattle ranch north of Great Falls that had been in operation for over a century.  Told that everything had been tried, but that the yield couldn't be improved.  Designed a new water distribution system, materially reducing water losses and raising yield. - Told that our newborn son probably wouldn't make it, due to an unexpected, rare illness.  For months, collaborated, alongside my wife, day and night with nurses, doctors, and technicians.  Miraculously, our son not only survived, but is on a very good path.  We are even looking at dates when we can take him home.    I'm not delusional.  Beating Senator Daines will be damn tough.  But, we've got some good practice under our belt in overcoming big challenges.  Request your support, today.  And, together, let's retire Daines back to his D.C. and Belgrade mansions, where he belongs. secure.actblue.com/donate/jm4s",21,16,0,5,0,0,0,0,579563599471271,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=579563599471271&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2019-11-30 13:01:11,"Happy SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY!  Small businesses, above and beyond their core profitable offerings, strengthen our Main Streets and communities, throughout Montana and America. They enhance our social fabric. They hire locally and pay taxes. They serve as meeting points where locals come together to converse, laugh, & debate the issues. Their workers often volunteer in the community. Small businesses are contributing in an outsized manner to America.  I wish I could say the same about their large multinational competitors, backed by @stevedaines, whose lobbyists have created an unequal, unjust playing field, impacting our small businesses and communities. Daines is not a friend of small business and hopes people will mistake his fealty to large multinational corporations as being pro-business in general.   Daines, even before elected, suggested Great Depression II inducing policies in the wake of the Great Recession, which would have devastated small business. He has repeatedly voted to deprive tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Montanans, including those with pre-existing conditions, of basic health care coverage, attempting to make Montana’s and America’s workforce sicker and less productive, hurting small businesses. He then voted, late in the business cycle, to blow a multi-trillion dollar hole through the nation’s pocketbook, in order to give foreign investors, America’s wealthiest families, large multinational corporations, hedge fund managers, private equity fund managers, and powerful C-suite executives huge, one-time bonuses – shifting the competitive landscape even more against small businesses. He endorses an ill-advised, unilaterally conducted trade war against China that has hurt our Main Streets, our farmers and ranchers, our railroad workers, and others dependent on a thriving agricultural community – that’s not being small business friendly. He opposes sensible anti-trust regulation that will prevent large monopolies and monopsonies from crushing small business owners. He opposes net neutrality, which is a life-line for small businesses. He opposes public education which supplies small businesses quality workers, and trains the next generation of entrepreneurs. He is aligned with those who wish to sell off America’s public lands, which provide our nation and Montana an economic competitive advantage, driving small businesses forward. He opposes clean energy, a huge opportunity for small businesses, and, at the same time, has presided over the decimation of traditional energy industries by refusing to acknowledge the stark reality of climate change.   Conversely, I’m pro-small business.  I’m of the business sector with an MBA from London Business School.  I’ve owned a Montana ranch and farm – not inherited, purchased through hard work.  I’ve lived in rural Montana, including Eastern, Central, and Western Montana, and get the challenges and needs of rural America’s small businesses.   I understand small business and salute our small businesses which are strengthening our country, despite an uneven playing field.  They need a champion in the U.S. Senate, immediately. #mtpol #mtsen #mtnews #chamberofcommerce #rotaryclub #smallbusinesssaturday",13,12,0,1,0,0,0,1,576898916404406,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=576898916404406&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2019-11-25 15:17:35,"Hi Folks, I wanted to give you an update on our son, Leo – our little hero.  Earlier this fall, Leo was born into this world quite premature and contracted a serious illness.  For the last two months, my wife Claudia and I have been, with the fewest of exceptions, beside Leo’s isolet in a Level IV Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit, while encouraging the nurses, doctors, and medical technicians whom have been providing him care.  Leo’s first name, Leonidas, was well chosen, because he is both a lion and a warrior.  He completed a long antibiotics course and underwent surgical intervention and has rebounded in a way that almost no one expected.  He is now, miraculously, doing very well and on a good path.  In fact, we are looking at a near-term date when we can take him home.  Claudia and I love Leo like nothing else and are infinitely proud of him.  In addition, I couldn’t be prouder of my wife, who is a wonderful mom and the best life partner I could imagine.  An immigrant from a small village in Sardinia, Claudia has done so much in the nonprofit sector and as an AmeriCorps volunteer to help Americans in need.  Leo and I are incredibly lucky to have Claudia in our corner.     I just wanted to let you know our circumstances these last couple months, and to emphasize that we will be channeling Leo’s fighting spirit as we return to the campaign trail.  We have participated in 15 events in Montana, from fundraisers to speeches before stakeholder and activist groups, in the last week alone, our first week back in months.  As Leo’s parents, we believe that, in this complex age, being the best parent possible also entails fighting for good policy.   We are forging on to give Montanans a Democratic nominee who can win the General Election and serve ALL Montanans in the U.S. Senate with integrity, competence, empathy, and creativity.  I’m committed to fighting for a future that is prosperous, safe, livable, and joyful for Leo and all of our kids, and successive generations of Montanans in perpetuity.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-11-21 14:35:24,"I've been asked my thoughts, as a U.S. Senate candidate in Montana, on the current impeachment hearing. My main takeaways: - Career service in government is noble. The performance, competence, and patriotism of the testifying U.S. State Department officials, in particular, have been the finest promotional materials for a career in America's civil service. This can be extended to local and state governmental service. Without dedicated and talented civil servants, at all levels, in the United States, our country cannot thrive. We typically reserve the moniker ""thank you for your service"" to military personnel. I'd like to say, ""Thank you for your service to each of you who has dedicated your life to the most noble undertaking of serving our country, our state, and our communities in the civil service."" (For an interesting read, see former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's ""Keeping At It"", which makes a persuasive case for the urgent need in America for renewed focus on civil servant careers.) - It is interesting how the different political parties have responded to the rise of unprecedented economic inequality, and its concomitant effects. The Democratic Party, in my opinion, this election cycle, has responded quite well. A renewed focus of progressivism has taken root, with multiple approaches from which to choose. Trumpism, as well, is a response to unprecedented economic inequality and the fraying fabric of our communities. But, since acquiring power, it has pursued policies and frameworks that would make this problem worse: a unilateral trade war, massive tax cuts for America's wealthiest, budget cuts to basic services for the poor, xenophobia and racism, non-value add debt explosion, and aversion to clean energy. How is this at all related to the impeachment hearing? Applying non-solutions to the great issues we face as a nation is analogous to the Republican Party's lockstep defense of the indefensible and contra-constitutional acts of the Trump Administration. - Russia is not our friend, nor will be in our lifetime, however much we want it to be not so, even beyond Putin. In my estimation, the fault line, especially as the world transitions to renewable energy, will grower starker, as the Russian economy is disproportionately reliant on oil and gas. Even in my own political party, apologists exist for the most egregious Russian behavior. I would hope, given a Top Secret/SCI clearance and inner visibility into Russia's active and growing multi-dimensional threat to the U.S., that their tune would change. But a useful correlation is this: when Putin's Russia or its proxies support something, it usually means that that something is NOT in the best interests of America. Russia's support of the 21st century Republican Party - through 2016 and 2018 election interference, through support of the National Rifle Association, through support of potential third-party candidates who would certainly cannibalize Democratic voters - should give every American real pause.",28,27,0,1,0,0,0,2,569679223793042,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=569679223793042&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2019-10-15 21:59:52,"Pleased to report that we led Montana's US Senate Democratic candidates in 3rd Quarter fundraising.   Despite announcing for US Senate well after the quarter's start; having zero name recognition prior to our announcement; never being interviewed on national television; NOT accepting any Corporate PAC money; and canceling our biggest fundraisers of the quarter because of the early birth of our son. That said, money in politics should not be an important metric on which journalists report breathlessly.  It should be ""a"" metric among the more important facets of merit, ideas, integrity.  Today, the scales are tipped so heavily towards money that the patently unfit Steve Daines is our US Senator.  What about merit, ideas, integrity? We need real, substantive CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM, which will be a TOP PRIORITY of mine in the US Senate.  We need to work towards a day in Montana and our country where, say, the single mother of two kids in Lewistown, Virginia City, Forsyth, Hall, or Big Fork - all towns, among many others, we visited last quarter - without a wealthy network or relatives, without the support of special interest groups, without celebrity sponsorships, without coverage by national television networks, without titles, can not only run for higher office, but win, because her ideas have been allowed ""airtime"" and were deemed best for community, state, country, and planet.  I don't see why that's infeasible given 21st century tools and elected officials who can solve - not run from or worsen, like Senator Daines - challenging problems. But we need to rise up and overcome the barrage of Corporate PAC and Dark Money supporting politicians like Senator Daines in order to get good people into office. That's why I'm asking you to double down on our campaign, to circle the wagons, and to direct our collective horsepower on our candidacy.  We can and will beat Senator Daines.  He knows it.  We know he knows it.  But he hopes the memo doesn't get out in time. We don't need nearly as much money as Senator Daines to beat him.  But we need enough to communicate our merit and his lack of it; our ideas for the future and his nihilism; our commitment to serve Montana and our country, and his fealty to himself and President Trump.

Every senator is at times culpable of regrettable silence.  But you have taken such silence to a new, weird level.

Hardly comprehensive, your history of condemnable silence includes: - U.S. betrayal of our Kurdish Allies and captured ISIS fighters escaping in Syria - Mohammed Bin Salman's killing of the American-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi - Russian interference in U.S. elections and information operation campaign against Western democracies - Neo-Nazis marching the streets of Charlottesville, VA and death of Heather Heyer - Trump's depiction of free press as ""enemy of the people"", a Stalin term - Trump's attempted exchange of Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections for military aid - Kim Jong Un's continued development of North Korea's nuclear warhead and missile technology - Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, transforming that country into the next Afghanistan - Climate change - Unprecedented economic inequality - U.S. Senate confirmation of fundamentalist, reactionary U.S. administrators, from Scott Pruitt to Betsy Devos to William Barr - 20+ women's credible accusations of sexual harassment against Trump - Mass shootings in synogogues, churches, mosques, concerts, theaters, clubs, schools, Walmart - Systemic separation of mothers and their children along our southern border And more...

John Mues for Montana,,2019-10-09 13:07:05,"Erdogan... A dictator who put the friends of a dear friend, simply for believing in democracy, as Ataturk believed, in jail. An autocrat whose duplicity put the lives of thousands upon thousands of American military personnel at risk when I served. A 1 toe in NATO, 9 toes in Putin's tank kind of guy. An apologist for genocide, against the Armenians. Someone less concerned about ISIS than the Kurds whom have helped the US liberate Syria and Iraq from the ISIS scourge. Now, empowered by President Trump, Erdogan's troops move against the Kurds, and Erdogan is invited to the White House. A possible parallel: once, the mujahideen of Afghanistan worked hand in hand with the US to oust the Soviet Union, a mutual enemy, and that was a seed that eventually led to Al Qaida and 9/11.  Now, a far more capable group, the Kurds, who have worked with the US to destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria, have been epically betrayed by the US under President Trump, with Erdogan's troops right now moving in on them. I doubt the Kurds will forget. I hope a future, near-term, new Administration and US Senate can mend this wound. Clearly, domestic policy has suffered under President Trump and his yes men acolytes, like my opponent Senator Daines.  But foreign policy and national security have been equally put at risk.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-09-25 12:59:18,"A number of people have reached out to our U.S. Senate campaign and asked how I see President Trump's alleged ""offer"" to Ukraine President Zelensky to trade a Ukrainian investigation into Biden's, his political opponent's, son for $250 million of needed military aid.   And, whether I view this as an impeachable offense, if verified. The latter question, first.  I do view this as an impeachable offense, if verified, and support a facts-driven process moving forward.   Some are mortified that President Trump, effectively, has requested to horse trade Ukrainian interference into the U.S. presidential election for cash and arms.  I'm likewise alarmed, though hardly surprised.  We know well the character of President Trump. But that's not the fifth of it.  Fundamentally, this is President Trump doing, yet again, the bidding of Vladimir Putin's Russia Federation.  And on multiple fronts.  1) Putin isn't pleased with Zelensky, the new reformist Ukrainian president.  Zelensky has referred to Putin as ""an enemy"".  Zelensky has also stated that he wishes to re-annex Crimea, the portion of Ukraine that Russia invaded and stole, and wishes to tie up closer to NATO.  Had Zelensky agreed to President Trump's terms, then the anti-corruption Ukrainian president's reputation would have become compromised, opening a path for a pro-Putin (or less anti-Putin) opponent in Ukrainian politics.  I'm skeptical that President Trump was thinking along these lines when he tried to barter with Zelensky, but who knows?  Irrespective, Putin has turned Trump, through his vulnerability to flattery, propensity to choose self over country, and transactional nature, into an ""unwitting agent"", as a former CIA Director described. 2) Putin wishes to restore the territorial integrity of the former Soviet Union and retake large swaths of Eastern European territory.  Near-term, perhaps, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, in prioritized order.  President Trump's threat to withhold material military funding to Ukraine equates to an existential threat to Ukraine - not only to the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, which is a combat zone and has been infiltrated by Russian state and non-state assets, but all Ukrainian sovereign ground.  President Trump, apparently, sees nothing wrong with Putin's forces running roughshod over Ukraine's remaining independence.   3) President Trump recently withdrew from the longstanding Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) that had been a pillar of Cold War (and post-Cold War)  nuclear arms reduction and management efforts.  Again, Putin had wanted such an outcome.  In effect, Western Europe (as well as Europe as a whole) are now far more vulnerable to Russian aggression - perhaps not tomorrow, but in time.  Putin's Kremlin spokespersons have already threatened a European country with, yes, a nuclear strike for showing too much interest in joining NATO's missile defense program (see Kremlin response to Denmark).  With INF defunct, Russia may now develop intermediate range nuclear weapons with impunity and ramp up its intimidation of Eastern European countries tacking towards the West, and Western European countries that protest too heavily Putin's authoritarianism and lawlessness. 4) President Trump, under the guise of having NATO member countries ""pay their fair share"", has disproportionately criticized America's truest historical allies, and curried favor at every turn with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and even North Korea.  The fissures between the U.S. and other NATO countries is, again, another Trump love letter to Vladimir Putin.  In order to execute Russia's long-term strategy of reacquiring European territory, NATO must be weakened, if not unwound.  President Trump's anti-NATO rhetoric - however glossed in financial accountability - is precisely what Putin would have wished in a U.S. president. 5) Nearly half of Russia's economy is hydrocarbon dependent.  With clean, renewable energy gaining traction globally, stunting hydrocarbon market demand, and oversupply further driving prices downward, Russia has reason to be concerned.  Rather than support innovation, freedom, dissent, and critical thinking inside Russia, Putin has pushed to undermine substitutes to hydrocarbon fuel and power.  In President Trump, a climate change denier, he has found the ideal U.S. president to protect Russia's hydrocarbon-laden economic interests. 6) Per the ""Mueller Report"", Russia intentionally interfered in America's 2016 presidential election in order to weaken HRC and, however unlikely, help DJT become U.S. President.  Based on the points above, and others I've not included or not been aware of, Putin's investment in undermining American democracy has clearly had a high Return on Investment. No one in America should be above the law.  Allow the whistleblower report to be reviewed in full by Congress, allow the whistleblower, among others, to speak before Congress, and allow the facts, and the facts alone, to lead America to the right decision regarding the presidency of Donald J. Trump.",36,32,0,4,0,0,0,8,524367521657546,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=524367521657546&id=445262262901406

John Mues for Montana,,2019-09-14 21:41:08,"I'd like to wish Jack Ballard of Red Lodge, MT a speedy recovery and all the best moving forward. Jack's love of Montana and its outdoors and public lands and the environment made him an easy US Senate candidate to like.   Jack spoke in Lewistown, MT to Fergus County Democrats shortly before I did, about a month ago.  It was clear to me, in listening to him, that he was running for the US Senate for the right reasons - not for show, not to seize the next rung, not for the media attention, not for the bright lights, but out his deep-seated love for Montana, and, being knowledgeable, to further the conversation.  I can tell when someone is being genuine, and he was.  I can tell when someone is informed, and he was.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-09-12 13:21:53,"Kelly McCarthy Endorses John Mues to be Elected to the U.S. Senate “I’m honored to endorse my friend and fellow veteran, John Mues, to be the next US Senator from Montana.  He is our first best choice to make sure Montana remains The Last Best Place.” -Kelly McCarthy  Air Force veteran and former Montana House of Representatives leader from Yellowstone County, Kelly McCarthy, announced his endorsement of the candidacy of John Mues to serve all Montanans in the U.S. Senate.  John Mues is a 4th generation Montanan, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, a veteran and former naval officer with service in Middle East and a former public school teacher, who grew up in Deer Lodge, Helena and Wolf Point.  He earned his MBA from the London Business School and has a career in the private sector as an energy development engineer, including renewable energy development.   With his endorsement of John Mues to be elected to the U.S. Senate, Kelly McCarthy issued this statement:   “I’d like to share my great enthusiasm and gratitude to have John Mues in the race to be Montana’s next US Senator.  John has proven his willingness to put service to our nation ahead of his personal well-being with his service in the US Navy and then later proved his commitment to Montana when he returned home to be part of the Troops to Teachers program. While our incumbent Senator can’t decide whether to bow to Donald Drumpf or kowtow to Xi Jinping in their ego fueled trade war, John will be fighting for Montana farmers and ranchers.  He understands working Montanans because he is a working Montanan. He’s not afraid to meet them face to face and hear their stories. Job one when he returned to Montana was to help improve education outcomes in our reservation communities.  John won’t just show up on parade day and then turn his back on our first Montanans when he’s in DC. He understands that a nation is only as great as the promises that it keeps. With a current Senator intent on taking our nation backward by rolling back the clock and rolling up the red carpet for anyone that doesn’t look like him, John will protect the rights of all Montanans and make sure that every Montanan has a seat at the table.  I’m honored to endorse my friend and fellow veteran, John Mues, to be the next US Senator from Montana.  He is our first best choice to make sure Montana remains The Last Best Place.”",101,83,5,10,0,1,2,23,515781129182852,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=515781129182852&id=445262262901406

For those who may not know, Silver State Post is in a politically ""reddish"" community in Montana.  Thus, the endorsement is both significant and courageous, and underscores our ability, without compromising principles, to win every single county in Montana.  We won't be satisfied with a mere win against Senator Daines (R), but a win by a margin that helps reset our state and our country. This is a race of putting Country over Partisanship.  Country over Politics.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-08-31 18:09:21,"Our 56 County U.S. Senate Mues-for-Montana Road Trip drives forward with one mission in mind: to beat Senator Daines (R) on 03 November, 2020. Along the way, our candidacy secured multiple coveted endorsements, from Dorothy Bradley to Lawrence Pettit (others to be announced shortly), and confirmed 18 fundraisers throughout Montana and beyond. Two-Week Summary (12-26 Aug, 2019), most recent at top: 39. Stayed the night in TERRY, in PRAIRIE COUNTY, at a nice, clean, recently renovated little motel – the Diamond! Though I wasn’t able to check out the famous Evelyn Cameron Museum, as I had hoped – that’s on my bucket list still – had a good stopover. Swung by the Terry Tribune newspaper and it appears we’ll be having an interview by phone here shortly, once the editor gets back into town. And great talking to Leann Lantis, a small business owner who, at the end of our chat, asked if I was a Dem or a Rep. When I told her Democrat, she gave me a fist bump in front of a line of local customers, most of them ranchers and farmers. Pretty cool: public fist bump for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Terry, MT. I’ll be back, and not just for EC’s pioneering photography. 38. What a beautiful town GLENDIVE is! Between Mikoshika State Park, just a skip away, the Yellowstone River, and tidy quaint neighborhoods, Glendive has so much to offer. Many thanks to Pat & Brenda Mischel, Terry & George Skeritt, and Sue Peterson who rounded up good Democrats for an impromptu and generous Meet n’ Greet at the hip Bloom Coffeehouse and Eatery. Drove by the hemp fields outside of Glendive, an intriguing development with palpable local support and real potential. Also, stole away for a little hike at Mikoshika State Park, one of Montana’s public lands gems, and videoed a quick riff, posted on Twitter and Facebook, on the importance of public lands and the disturbing silence (and true colors) of Senator Daines as the completely unfit William Pendley takes BLM’s reins. 37. Great to hang out with RICHLAND COUNTY DEMOCRATS in SIDNEY. A huge shout out to Janet and Paul Martineau for spearheading the Meet ‘n Greet, and for the generous lodging! Great talking to Janet and Dale Spracklin, Helen & Karlon Schmitt, and others! Enjoyed a great rib-eye at the South 40 Restaurant with good Democrats, and then went over and struck up a conversation with a table of Trump supporters (my assumption, given the Trump 2020 hats). Was told I was brave, but, honestly, I want their vote – because they’ve been voting against their best interests for too dang long! The next morning met with Amy Venn, Managing Editor at Sidney Herald. Then went on to chat with Bill Vander Weele at Sidney Area Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture. Also touched bases with Rep. Joel Krautter (R) and Leslie Messer, Executive Director of Richland County Economic Development. Lots of good things to point to in Sidney, yet lots of serious near and medium-term challenges. Folks are looking for a leader who listens and can problem solve. 36. I threw the rig in reverse, from Miles City, and headed southwest on I-94 to FORSYTH for lunch. Many thanks to the talented Marvin Quinlan – lawyer, rancher, farmer, nonprofit board member, advocate - for arranging a great conversation with Yvonne Becker, John Haggard, Howard Kelley, Dwayne Albertson, Paula Seleski, and others at Speedway Cafe in FORSYTH, ROSEBUD COUNTY yesterday. Wonderful discussion ranging from the ongoing corrosive politicization of our governmental agencies to the importance of corporate anti-trust review! And thank you for the article in the local Forsyth newspaper about our visit! Look forward to getting back to Forsyth for Melcher & Manning! 35. Enjoyed kicking around at the EASTERN MONTANA FAIR in MILES CITY, and talking to Bert and Molly at the booth and (another) Molly who gave me the low-down on the Champion of Champions Steer Competition. Great as well talking to Sandra Anderson – what a fascinating background and thank you for the advice. In addition, spoke at length with Michael Cressner, Orion’s director of wind farm development, about the 700+ MW wind farm going in in Rosebud, Custer, and Garfield Counties, which could nearly double Montana’s wind power generation! A special thanks to Super-Democrat Hannah Nash for the Meet ‘n Greet, and to Marie Wehri, Deborah Hanson, Lee Richardson, Kay Carlson, among many others. Also, really enjoyed time spent with Councilman Rick Huber, who deeply loves his city, touring around beautiful Miles City - from Spotted Eagle Lake to the Confluence of Tongue and Yellowstone Rivers, to potential Industrial Parks to modernized Water Treatment Plant, to key neighborhoods, to levees, to closed VA Center, to Eastern Montana Veterans Cemetery. And thank you to Bob, Marilyn, and Josh Thaden, the owners of TONGUE RIVER WINERY, for their hospitality and lodging (they were also hosting travelers from India to Iran!). What an amazing enterprise Tongue River Winery is, a true extension of Bob, Marilyn, and Josh themselves, a can’t miss experience if you’re in Eastern Montana. 34. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of the INDIVISIBLE-led podcast, PODCAST RUNS THRU IT, in LIVINGSTON. In particular, thank you to Dixie Hart, Stuart Nelson, Nelson King, and Jerry Cole. What a heady team! And the SoundColor Studios venue, on the 3rd floor of the once Livingston School Foundation, was super cool. Now I just need to find out when it will air, as people are asking. 33. Thank you to standout high school sophomores Bea Erickson & Daisy Kulina in MISSOULA for sitting down with me at Café Dolce, one of my and my wife’s favorite Western MT hang out spots, in order to talk gun safety, 2nd Amendment, climate, women’s empowerment, even ageism. You two, once again, are just impressive! And thank you to Erin Erickson, Jodi Kulina, and Susie Orr for coordinating the meeting. As our next U.S. Senator from Montana, I can assure you, I’ll be the opposite of Senator Daines, on every level. When a young woman approaches me with an earnest question about a life and death matter, more than validated by the recent series of mass shootings, I won’t condescend, patronize, and recite the script handed to me by special interests. Rather, I’ll listen, learn, and take appropriate action. 32. In KALISPELL, met with FLATHEAD COUNTY DEMOCRATS, led by the always impressive Lynn Stanley. Again, always good hanging out with Democrats, and particularly so when it’s in a red county like Flathead. Thank you, on very short notice, for the opportunity to address such a capable, motivated, and potent group of Montana Democrats! And thank you for your questions, including: “How can you win in Montana’s red areas?” I hope my answer was compelling. 31. Spent the night at a generous Democrat’s house in Bozeman, then hit the road at 4:30am to have a productive late morning meeting with Dan Weinberg and Karen and Richard Hinman of WHITEFISH at the incredible nonprofit “Wave” fitness and wellbeing center. Inside or outside, architecturally and functionally impressive! Then swung by the Whitefish Farmers’ Market before driving to Kalispell. Looking forward to our Whitefish Fundraiser on 11 September! Thank you! 30. It was a privilege to attend #MomsDemandAction event in BILLINGS, and thank you to Penny Ronning and Kiely Lammers for the opportunity to say some public words about gun violence and policy. And wonderful to talk with so many good folks: Kathy Kelker, Meagen Heenan, Penny Ronning, Kiely & Rich Lammers, Joan (head of #WalktoFightSuicide), Shawna Goubeaux & Judy Hanrahan of #406Pride(thanks for the 406 Pride shirt & generosity!), Anne Harris, Kay Carlson & Bob, Uri (thanks for your generosity!), and so many others! Yes, together, we can make a big difference in our public health emergency and epidemic in Montana and the country which is gun violence. #MomsDemandAction, with compelling facts, passion, organization, fearlessness, and iconic red shirts, is leading the way! 29. Honor to participate in CROW FAIR parade. Great to meet Newton Old Crow Sr., Jason Small, Conrad Stewart, Steven Not Afraid, Henry Rides Horse, Esther Wynne & Dr. Bob Wilson, and many others. Discussed issues from health care to law enforcement, energy to climate, indigenous language to education. As the only US Senate candidate who has taught on a MT reservation (Ft. Belknap), as the only who has served in a combat zone like so many Native Americans - a special thanks to Newton Old Crow Sr. for his distinguished service in the Korean War - and as the only who grew up in part on a MT reservation (Ft. Peck), I can say that I will indefatigably champion Native rights & opportunity. I will always be available to our Native communities and nations, and will listen, learn, and tirelessly fight for your best interests. As I have learned in Wolf Point, Hays-Lodgepole, Crow Agency, and so many other Native communities, incredible talent is everywhere. Opportunity, in turn, must be extended everywhere, too. That's not only a moral imperative, it's a pragmatic one as well. 28. Had a great meeting with Martha Stahl at PLANNED PARENTHOOD, which helps so many people, women and men, and, in particularly, underserved women. Thank you for your bravery and commitment to our diverse Montana communities! I’m looking forward to the tour! 27. Attended the MONTANA STATE FAIR at the Metra Center in BILLINGS. Talked to a number of veterans including a fellow submariner – a true Cold War hero who kept that war, for the most part, cold - and former State Commander of the VFW. Sir, looking forward to addressing a plenary of Montana veterans the next time we meet! Had a spirited chat with a second group of veterans who couldn’t understand why I was, though a veteran and member of business community, a Democrat. Because, it’s the most courageous of political choices, I told them. Very easy to bow down, in an age of unprecedented economic inequality, before trillion dollar market capitalized multinational corporations and right-wing billionaires. Far more courageous to stand up for the rights of all people, and for our state and country. More than half were nodding their heads affirmatively. Then hung out with great Yellowstone County Super-Democrats from Frannie Bonogofsky to Nancy Coleman to Diane Wellhaven. Really enjoyed it, and great picture! 26. The drive to COLSTRIP is spectacular, in that rugged Eastern Montana way. I was almost late for Energy Days in Colstrip because I kept pulling the old Jeep over to take pictures of the gorgeous countryside. When I arrived, it was great to see Al Ekblad of AFL/CIO, who had brought the event to my attention, and Mark Sweeney, who appropriately said, “Good to see another Democrat down here!” We as Democrats need to contest everywhere because most “red counties” should be “blue counties”. With Plants 1 and 2 scheduled to close by end of year, anxiety in Colstrip is obviously high. We need to be a bit creative when talking about economic development in places like Colstrip, and we need to be honest with people. Thank you, as well, to Jim Atchinson, head of Southeastern Montana Development Corporation, who deeply cares about his community, and to the entrepreneurs, research and think tanks, nonprofits, and elected officials with whom I had the opportunity to speak. And thank you for the tour of Rosebud Plant and Westmoreland Mine. Great speaking with Sabrina Neiman, who really understands Colstrip, and Julie Emmons, also of SE MT Dev Corps. Finally, great brainstorming with Trevor Graff of MT Environmental Policy Office, Kirk Keysor of Econ Dev Administration, and Terry Brix of OCO. I am, net-net, optimistic about the community of Colstrip. But I will say: continuing to vote for those who deny climate change will not lead to a positive outcome for Colstrip or any other community. 25. Right after the FERGUS COUNTY Dems’ Picnic, checked out the Lewistown Street Party with live music. Plunged into the crowd with a bunch of MuesforMontana.com stickers. A group of guys and gals came up to me and brusquely inquired, “Are you a Democrat or a Republican?” I told them that I was a proud, lifelong Democrat. They then said, “Well, that’s alright, man, keep going! You’ve got our support!” It probably helped that I had told them that I’m the only candidate, Democrat or Republican, who has served our country in the Middle East. That I’m the only candidate to live in rural MT. That I’m the only candidate self-made in the business sector. That I grew up humbly and am a 4th generation Montanan. That I’m the only public school teacher in the race, and in an underserved MT community not far from Lewistown. When I circled back through the crowd, I saw that a number of folks had MuesforMontana.com stickers on. 24. Drove to LEWISTOWN for the Fergus County Democrats’ Picnic at Frank Day Park. I always love being around good committed Democrats. But when you’re talking to Democrats in a right-wing stronghold like Fergus County, it can be extra special. Thank you to Dean Martin for organizing and to Mike Chapman, Mary Jo Hamling, Clayton Dunlap, Scott Sweeney, Jeanne Moe, Art, and Joanne! And, thanks to Steve and Tiffany (“Tiff”) for making me more aware of the AWARE program for the disabled. You, as a couple, are great and inspiring! And great pic, thanks for forwarding it to me! And thank you, Fergus County Democrats, for allowing me to speak before your members and tell you about our mission to beat Senator Daines (R). 1-23.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-08-21 12:40:36,"Dorothy Bradley Endorses John Mues for U.S. Senate Montana thought-leader and accomplished public servant, Dorothy Bradley, announced today that she is endorsing John Mues to be elected to replace U.S. Senator Steve Daines.      With her endorsement of John Mues to be elected to the U.S. Senate, Dorothy Bradley issued this statement:   “I recently met John Mues at a gathering with friends, and without knowing he was running for office, I left the conversation thinking, ‘Now there is a gracious young Montanan with a lot of leadership potential.’  I was elated to discover that he is out on a political trail, and the more I know, the more hopeful I feel. “John’s background in the military service, energy engineering, and education is made to order for a country whose present leadership seems bent on foreign policy by whim, climate change by denial, and education-to-the-minimum. “I am as exhausted by our rudeness to each other as with the shrillness and fruitlessness of our politics.  Wallace Stegner called the west the “native land of hope”.  I’m thinking John is one of the new, young leaders rising to the fore that just might bring it back.” Throughout her career, Bradley served eight terms in the Montana House of Representatives from 1971 to 1978 and from 1985 to 1992.  Bradley ran two statewide campaigns, seeking election to the U.S. Congress and to serve as the Democratic nominee for Governor of Montana, during which she became well-known for riding her horse across the Big Sky State. “The modern leaders of Montana, including Dorothy Bradley, inspire my candidacy and give me the confidence that my focus on working for the benefit of all Montanans – not wealthy corporations and PAC money lobbyists – is the right strategy for Montana and for my campaign,” said John Mues.  “I am truly honored to have the enthusiastic endorsement of Dorothy Bradley, one of Montana’s most significant thought-leaders and contributors in public policy and service to fellow Montanans.”    About John Mues John Mues is a candidate running a campaign to defeat U.S. Senator Steve Daines in the Fall 2020 election.  Mues is a 4th generation Montanan who was raised in a single-parent household in Helena, Deer Lodge, and Wolf Point, the son of a social worker mother and Vietnam Veteran father who worked as a union letter carrier. The beneficiary of quality public school teachers and coaches in Montana, John received a Congressional nomination to the U.S. Naval Academy, from which he graduated with academic honors while lettering in Division I sports.  John then trained in the U.S. Navy as a submarine warfare officer and nuclear engineer, as well as attaining Army Airborne Parachutist and Navy Diver qualifications. While overseas on active military duty, John applied to the Troops-to-Teachers program and worked towards a teaching certificate through Montana State University.  Two months after being honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy, he began two years of differentiated service to country as a high school math and English teacher on the Ft. Belknap Indian Reservation in north central Montana, helping build programs that encourage student success and recognition in one of the state’s highest needs schools. In 2008, as the Great Recession set in, John entered the private sector as a senior engineer in the energy sector, where he has worked for the past 11 years making America energy independent, pursuing renewable clean energy, and contributing to living wage jobs in Montana and throughout the country.  During this period, he also earned a Master in Business Administration (MBA) from the London Business School John and his wife Claudia, a non-profit leader, live near Loma in the north central part of Montana. They are expecting their first child, the 5th generation of John’s family to call Montana home, later in 2019.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-08-14 06:31:08,"Our 56 County Mues-for-Montana Road Trip presses on.  Folks want to beat Senator Daines and, now that we’ve announced, understand that it’s no longer just aspirational.  Daines gets it too.  Here’s the latest weekly summary (05-11 Aug 2019) – and, our 1 month campaign anniversary!  To date, we’ve got 17 fundraisers scheduled, the majority in-state but also fundraisers from the Bay Area to NYC to Las Vegas (Americans naturally want to Flip the Senate).  5 official endorsements.  2 newspaper endorsements.  3 Op-Eds published in major MT newspapers.  The generous support of a former very popular MT Governor.  Again, after only 1 month.  23. ANACONDA/GEORGETOWN LAKE.  Scored a ticket – thanks, Tom! – and showed up at the Saint Timothy’s Auction by Denton’s Point at Georgetown Lake.  Met so many wonderful people, while listening to the “Short-Notice Band”.  Great meeting Joyce, Bee, Susan, Wes, Dusty, Connie, John, Michelle, Ed, another Ed, Grace, Catherine, and Marie, among others.  The weather, as well, with the Pintler Mountains as backdrop and the lake a stone’s throw away, could not have been nicer.  An overall fantastic experience.       22. HALL.  Met with the salt of the earth in Sue and Randy Peterson at their ranch just outside of Hall.  Strategized, talked policy from guns to climate, and laid out a good plan moving forward.  Also good to meet Ty, a Marine and fellow veteran, and the precocious Halie and Hannah.  Can’t thank these great Montanans enough!  21. PHILIPSBURG.  Interviewed with the Philipsburg Mail newspaper – thanks, Tom Mullen!  Clearly, I’m not letting Senator Daines off the hook for his aberrant voting record and personal behavior.  Also, attended the local Rotary Club meeting.  What can I say?  Philipsburg is one of the great turnaround stories in Montana, if not beyond.  And the energy, organization, and competence I witnessed at the Rotary Club underscored why.  Met Steve, a former sheriff, and chatted gun policy, about four John’s, Jim Jenner – the “Saving the ‘Burg” documentarian – and many others!  Then visited the fantastic Philipsburg Brewery, including its bottling facility – thanks Cathy and Nolan and their brewers Mike and Ben!  (Learned that Ben is also an MBA with study in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics!)  There is a clear leadership lesson at Philipsburg Brewery.  When owners treat their employees with respect and challenge them with intriguing problem sets, they stick around.  Mike was employee #1, and is still going strong with the brewery.  Also, had a helluva good business-to-business person discussion with Mark at Philipsburg Creamery.  That small business owner, who gets frustrated with the lack of business acumen of too many political candidates, may just give us his vote - because we get it.  And that’s just one of about fifty reasons why we’re going to beat Senator Daines – our ability to connect and collaborate with small business owners like Mark.     20. BOZEMAN.  Attended Clean Energy Fair.  Let me report how awesome and inspiring it was to meet entrepreneurs, experts, technicians, and concerned citizens from all over MT at the Clean Energy Fair with a common goal in mind: keep this a livable planet!  Good talking w Cody at Northern Plains, Representative & PSC Candidate Tom Woods, Sara Blessing & Greg Findley, John Jones, Mary, Andrew of MREA, Jenn at Aero, David of Sierra Club, Bethany at MCV, Karl at MontPIRG, Kyle at Harvest Solar, Brian at MEIC, & John at Morone Wind Energy. Great & knowledgeable folks. 19.  WESTERN MONTANA FAIR.  Hung out with great Missoula County Democrats at the booth at the Western Montana Fair.  Thank you to Susie, Pam, Chase, and Tom, as well as all the folks who stopped by to learn more about the Missoula County Democrats, Bryce Bennett’s run for Secretary of State, and our run for the U.S. Senate.  Also, put on a pink shirt in support of the “Tough Enough for Pink” theme recognizing women (and men too) impacted by cancer.   18.  VETERANS.  Can’t thank Charlie Brown, a fellow veteran (hard-core Medevac type) and former head of the American Legion, enough for his guidance.  Met with Charlie and a number of other vets and outstanding citizens at Worden’s over a tasty sandwich.  Thank you to Robbin, Tom, Bob, Ron, and Ryan for the great conversation as well as substantive policy discussion on veterans’ care, general health care, and foreign policy.  Quite moving to learn of Bob’s son’s long bout with cancer, but glad to hear it’s going in the right direction.  What’s not good to hear is that medical bills can thoroughly upend an entire family’s existence, which, of course, does not facilitate an optimal recovery.  We need to fix our health care system ASAP.  ACA was a step in the right direction.  It is, however, thoroughly insufficient.  First step to a much better health care system is to beat Senator Daines, who has soullessly voted to take away basic health care from countless Montanans and Americans, countless times.   17. MISSOULA.  Attended the Montana Trial Lawyer Association President’s Dinner, and met a number of standout Montanans – and one Texan and one Brit.  Had a number of good discussions from gun policy to the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal judge appointments.  Wonderful to see Al Smith, Gene Jarussi, Hillary Carls, Monica Lindeen, Mike Black (running for MT Supreme Court and a James Welch fan, as well!), and so many other leaders.  Our candidacy has an excellent chance of beating Senator Daines.  And the senator knows it.  At the end of the day, that’s our unrelenting mission:  to beat Senator Daines and restore the American Dream in Montana and throughout the country.   1-16.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-08-05 02:44:20,"Our 56 County Mues for Montana Road Trip keeps trucking with great momentum and enthusiasm. We're going to beat Senator Daines, folks. Here's a weekly summary (28 July-04 Aug 2019): 16.  Today, Sunday, just catching up on email and admin, and thinking back on yet another amazing week in our campaign for U.S. Senate.  We already have the U.S. House of Representatives, but without the U.S. Senate in hand, as well, our options oscillate between bad and unconscionably bad.  As a nation, we need to address the critical challenges of our day and times, and stop wasting time.  That’s why this race is, arguably, one of our nation’s most important.  Montana should be leading the charge in Flipping the Senate.  I believe it is, once again.    15.  In BOZEMAN on Saturday, we attended the Sweet Pea Festival and had a blast talking with artisans, sellers and buyers of amazing Montana goods.  We must be doing something right as I was downright shocked when, as we parked and got out of our truck, a family passed by and said, “We know you!  We think you can beat Senator Daines!  Keep it up!”  Well, Elizabeth, you’re right about that, and thank you for being prescient!  That’s, in fact, our central reason for running:  Beat Daines.   14.  In THREE FORKS, stood alongside union workers at the Imerys Talc Plant, commemorating their sacrifice and success from last year’s lock-out.  I’m not always easily moved, but this one got to me.  It’s important to remember that, while executive pay, hedge fund manager pay, private equity fund manager pay, investment bankers’ pay, foreign investors’ pay, and the stock market have skyrocketed over the last several decades, the American worker, normalized for inflation, has not gotten a pay raise.  The locked-out workers at Imerys stood solid for over 100 days, and ultimately got a multi-year deal that recognized their key value.  It was a hard-earned win-win outcome by which the best interests of Imerys and Montana workers were championed – as it should be in America.  It was an honor to be a part of this remembrance – sincere thanks to Al Ekblad, Randy Tocci, and Andrew Linton and the workers of Imerys for allowing us to participate.   13.  In DEER LODGE, had the pleasure of securing two important endorsements from state-wide stakeholders (announcement forthcoming), and a generous donation from a former popular governor.  Many thanks! 12.  In ANACONDA, took the Pintler Scenic Bypass through Anaconda – one of the most beautiful drives in Montana with majestic Mount Hagin on the left, the Flint Creek Mountains on the right, and Georgetown Lake, Discovery Ski Basin, and Philipsburg up ahead.  We stopped at the Anaconda Job Corps, ten miles outside of town, met with administrators, instructors, and students, took a generous 2 hour tour (thanks Duffy!), and walked away with a better sense of the debacle that Senator Daines caused, then walked back.  I also left with the belief that had Senator Daines not been up for re-election, the Anaconda Job Corps, notwithstanding the efforts of other stakeholders, would probably be closed under a Trump Administration.  But this should not be the debate:  close or keep open the Anaconda Job Corps.  Montana’s and America’s success in the 21st century will in large part depend on Education, including a strong emphasis on trade and vocational training.  That’s what the Job Corps – from Heavy Equipment Operator to Heavy Equipment Maintenance, from Culinary to Carpentry, from Fire Suppression to Bricklaying, from Basic to Advanced Welding – epitomizes.  One talented student, Josh, aspires to work for SpaceX!  We should be looking at strengthening such programs, which help all Montanans and Americans, not routinely threatening them with closure, or expecting thanks from their administrators, instructors, and students if we reverse our fickle decision to defund.  And, one last thing…  the Job Corps represents great diversity.  There are kids from all walks of life, and geographies.  It even supports those with disabilities.  For instance, Rob, an autistic student, is not only learning carpentry, he’s adding a second skill set in bricklaying, and has legitimate work options ahead.  And, he looks up to his instructors, Davin and Mark, as father figures.  Job Corps helps in all sorts of ways.  The sense of family I observed was not only atypical, it was inspiring.   11.  At FAIRMONT HOT SPRINGS, met with state-wide teachers, administrators, and labor leaders participating in the Montana Professional Teacher Foundation Golf Scramble, and camped out and shook hands with folks at the 12th Hole – it had a good-sized pond in front of the tee box so folks seemed to hang around a split second longer at the 12th, assessing their drive.  Met folks from every corner of the state who are helping kids achieve their dreams, and, in turn, making our state, country, democracy, and economy strong.  Thanks to Eric Feaver, Erik Burke, Lauren Caldwell, and others for the opportunity to attend.   10.  Had a great meeting with key folks from AFL/CIO in HELENA at Steve’s Café.  Saw Governor Bullock at Steve’s and shook hands with arguably our next POTUS.  Then met good folks at MFPE and MDP, and had a great conversation and lunch with Larry Pettit, an incredible resource.  Also, thank you Monica Abbott and Sherry Leone for the terrific support and offer of prime acreage for a Mues for Montana sign!  Absolutely can’t do it without you!      9.  In LOMA last Sunday evening, organized with the help of one of the biggest employers in Chouteau County a Meet & Greet with local ranchers and farmers.  As much as I love the good Democrats in Montana’s major towns and cities, I’m always impressed with Democrats in the state’s most rural, red counties.  These people are as principled and resistant to peer pressure as anyone in the country!  The other thing I’m finding is that a lot of so-called Republicans and Independents are ready to come home to the Democratic Party.  They just need someone in whom they can believe and trust, whom understands and appreciates all parts of Montana, and whom can tell the difference between a top, middle, and bottom line.  That’s why we’re going to beat Senator Daines, and by a margin that sends a signal throughout Montana and the country that if you're hyper-partisan, beholden to special interests, and care more about your major donors than the multitudes of Montanans, you're going to get your clock cleaned.        1-8.

John Mues for Montana,,2019-08-02 01:06:23,"My Op-Ed and ""Open Letter to U.S. Senator Steve Daines"", submitted 19 July, published in Missoulian yesterday.  (And stay turned for our next Op-Ed, recently submitted.) https://missoulian.com/opinion/columnists/daines-damages-montana-with-comments-votes/article_2dd1ce56-e205-5216-9998-1fe61518f22a.html An open letter to U.S. Sen. Steve Daines: Recently, Senator Daines, you called four young newly elected congresswomen of color — Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib — on Twitter, “Anti-American” and “Anti-Semite.” Rather than retract your statement, you then went onto Fox News, doubled down, and even threw around the word “terrorist.” A U.S. senator’s words can have real meaning. Given your position, a number of people follow and trust you. In your epithets against these women — on Twitter and Fox News — you have effectively called for action, even violence, against them. After all, according to you, they are “Anti-American,” “Anti-Semite” and somehow connected with terrorism. Yet, these women have done absolutely nothing wrong. Their perspectives on public policy are different than yours because of the diversity and inequities of the communities that they represent. But they are each as American as you or me, and they love their country every bit as much as we do. I would know, as I served as an Annapolis-commissioned naval officer alongside brave Americans from a multitude of backgrounds, whose diversity improved our teams’ effectiveness. In contrast, you have put these young women in harm’s way. This is not an outlying example, senator. You have turned a blind eye towards neo-Nazis and neo-fascists marching in Charlottesville, though countless American World War II soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen perished vanquishing the Third Reich, and though a young woman was murdered at the march by one of the neo-Nazis; the president’s borrowing of a phrase used by the Soviet Union’s Stalin to characterize the media as the “enemy of the people,” thus chilling free speech and placing journalists in our country and around the world in grave danger; the murder of an American-based journalist by Saudi Arabia, an oppressive regime which was then rewarded by retrograde policies you support; U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte’s body-slamming of a journalist for simply asking why he, as you, supports taking away affordable healthcare coverage from countless Montanans and other Americans; the president’s siding with Vladimir Putin, a former Soviet-era KGB officer, over our own intelligence agencies, with which I’ve worked; and, the 20-plus credible women whom have accused the president of sexual harassment or worse. One’s voting and policy advocacy record is also a window into one’s character. Yours has done damage to Montana and the United States. For instance, in this age of unprecedented economic inequality, you voted for a tax bill that widens that gap between the absolute wealthiest in America and the vast majority of us, straining our democracy. You voted to blow a multi-trillion-dollar hole through the nation’s pocketbook in order to give your major donors permanent tax cuts. You voted to transfer money from Montanan and American taxpayers into the pockets of wealthy foreign investors. You voted to cut Medicare and Social Security, though our seniors in Montana and throughout our country are already struggling. You supported President Trump’s withdrawal from both the Paris climate accords and the Iranian nuclear deal, seemingly doing the bidding of Saudi Arabia, which encouraged both actions. You voted for “short-term plans,” essentially fake insurance plans, in order to sabotage what little health care Montanans and Americans already have. You support President Trump’s trade war without having any end game and having trashed the international alliances we need to effectively stand up to China, hurting our farmers and ranchers. I look forward to debating our competing visions in the coming months. Until then, I ask that you consider this open letter and be a better representative of Montana through your term.",38,33,0,5,0,0,0,5,490842785010020,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=490842785010020&id=445262262901406
John Mues for Montana,,2019-07-30 16:44:00,"On July 30th 1965, Medicare became law, creating a program that has delivered healthcare coverage to countless Montanans. If elected, I'll always protect affordable healthcare for our state. Senator Daines carelessly put Medicare at risk with his tax cut for millionaires. What's to stop him from decimating benefits and driving up healthcare costs going forward? Montanans deserve a senator they can trust on healthcare—and that's not Steve Daines. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/19/republicans-approve-major-tax-code-overhaul-teeing-up-trump-signature/963505001/",21,18,0,0,0,0,3,0,489570511803914,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=489570511803914&id=445262262901406
John Mues for Montana,,2019-07-28 20:03:33,"Our 56-County-Mues-for-Montana road trip and mission to beat Senator Daines are now well underway.   So grateful for the simply incredible response to our run against Senator Daines at every single town and event we've visited.   Here's a quick end-of-week update:   8.  Today, Sunday, 28 July, I'm back in LOMA, catching up on email while grabbing a bite to eat at the one-of-a-kind Ma's Cafe off of 87N.  At the confluence of the Teton, Marias, and Missouri Rivers and the gates of the Upper Missouri River Breaks, with incredible Lewis and Clark and Native American history, the town of Loma, between Fort Benton and Big Sandy on Highway 87N, is truly one of Montana's best kept secrets.       7.  Yesterday, Saturday, hung out in HAVRE with a fantastic group of Hill County Democrats.  Followed that up with an interview at the office of the Havre Daily News, and then had an IPA at Triple Dog Brewery alongside Paul Tuss, CEO of Bear Paw Develop Corporation, chatting job creation and economic development on the Hi-Line.  And, with assistance from Kim Dudik and Raph Graybill, our excellent MT Attorney General candidates, helped a Havre couple who have been handed a potentially unjust eviction notice and are on the verge of homelessness.  (Vulnerable people need better affordable access to legal representation, a shortcoming throughout our country that can be remedied.)       6.  Surrogates - thanks Jon, Johnny, Brian, Matt, Amy, Jenny, and so many others - walked the Last Chance Stampede Parade in HELENA for me while I was driving north on 87N to visit the Hi-Line.           5.  Took a tour around FORT BENTON and did an interview at River Press.  With the Highwood Mountains in the background, meandering Missouri, Grand Union Hotel, and unparalleled history, Fort Benton is too picturesque not to visit.  4. Attended the MT Land Reliance event in BOZEMAN, and had the honor of meeting again Ambassador Max Baucus, the great Dorothy Bradley, THE Michael Keaton, Rock Ringling, and many other great Montanans.  Then spoke with MT Supreme Court Justice Mike Wheat about a spectrum of topics that can help improve the lives of all Montanans.    3.  On Friday, attended the NCAT ceremony in BUTTE recognizing the lifework of Kathy Hadley and heard great remarks from Senator Tester vis-a-vis Erik Nyland (and, frankly, empty, disingenuous remarks from a stand-in for Senator Daines, whom has worked tirelessly to de-fund NCAT).  NCAT does amazing work, from supporting low-income folks to working with small farmers.  Not Senator Daines' preferred people.      2. Attended Red Ants Pants Festival and Street Dance in WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, a key gateway to the inimitable Smith River.  What an incredible job Sarah Calhoun, the founder of Red Ants Pants and its sister festival, has done!  And, thank you, to Sharon for the generous offer of free billboard space for our campaign, and to so many others for your support.  We will be in touch!   1.  Attended Montana Conservation Voters event in BELGRADE and met incredible people concerned about the future of our planet and of our children and grandchildren.  Thank you to Aaron Murphy and MCV for the opportunity to meet so many great folks.       #MasCafe #Loma #Senate #MTPress #MuesforMontana #WhiteSulphurSprings #redantspantsfestival #Belgrade #Helena #Havre #RockyBoy #Bozeman #FortBenton #Butte",30,27,0,3,0,0,0,3,488557638571868,MuesforMontana,/story.php?story_fbid=488557638571868&id=445262262901406
