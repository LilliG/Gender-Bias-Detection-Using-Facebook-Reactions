"Tina Smith,Du Nord Craft Spirits",,2020-03-28 15:01:59,"A powerful and humbling story of Minnesotans uniting to help each other during this time. Thanks to Du Nord Craft Spirits, Loaves & Fishes, and all of the other organizations working around the clock to care for one another.Today I had an experience I would like to share. A gentleman named Lonnie from Loaves & Fishes stopped by the distillery today to pick up hand sanitizer. If you are not familiar with Loaves and Fishes, they provide hot meals to anyone in need. While Lonnie was at the distillery, and through the course of our brief conversation, he mentioned that one of their sites was Holy Rosary Catholic Church and he gestured to the northwest. When I moved to Minnesota from Indiana in 1991, we were dirt poor. We picked up food from food shelves, and I wore donated clothes and/or whatever we could find at goodwill. During this time I learned to hate, but tolerate, the orange/yellow blocks of government cheese we were given, and food stamps were still paper so you could get ‚Äúreal money‚Äù back in change. We often ate at soup kitchens and I remember liking the food there better than the stuff we had at home. I was 8 years old and had no real idea what ""poor"" really meant. One of our fist apartments was across from cockroach park in Minneapolis. The official name was not cockroach park, but that was the name everyone in the neighborhood had for it. It is a little park tucked in by Cedar ave and Hiawatha about a block from Little Earth. Facing the park was, and is, a big church: Holy Rosary Catholic Church. The church is northwest  of Du Nord Craft Spirits. While talking to Lonnie the pieces coalesced in my head: The eight-year-old version of me had eaten dinners at Holy Rosary‚Ä¶ I was a guest of Loaves and Fishes. I remembered being able to take some food home too and being so happy to have it. Now in the midst of a pandemic nearly 30 years later, I was donating hand sanitizer to the organization that fed me as a child. We are in a time where our fates are so closely intertwined yet we are so isolated. Now more than ever we need to step up to help each other out. But for the donations of time and money that provided for those meals, I would have gone to bed hungry those nights in the winter of ‚Äô91. I have more emails than I can count from people wanting to help pay for or distribute sanitizer. I have staff who asked to be laid off if it would mean their coworkers could stay on the job. I have seen the Lonnys of the world in non-profits across the state double their efforts to help those in need.  I am humbled today, and I hope I stay that way. There is so much good out there and people are working so hard for their fellow brothers and sisters that I am sure we get to the other side of this better than we were before. I hope this message finds you all safe, warm, and well fed. -Chris Montana Husband/Dad/Owner, Du Nord Craft Spirits",119,94,1,24,0,0,0,0,3207446339479573,TinaSmithMN,/story.php?story_fbid=3207446339479573&id=2040270322863853

Tina Smith,,2020-03-26 23:33:30,"Last night, the Senate passed a bipartisan coronavirus bill ‚Äî offering some much-needed relief to American families, small businesses, hospitals, and local and state governments. Some of the highlights of the bill include: -Unemployment benefits will be extended, expanded, and increased to help more workers -Forgivable loans will be available to support small businesses and nonprofits, so they can keep more people on their payroll and so more workers can keep their jobs -Hospitals will receive a significant increase in funding to support their services -Providers, especially those in rural areas, will receive increased Medicare payments to get much-needed funding -New investments will be made in COVID-19 research and in medical supplies -There will be worker and transparency protections on government loans -Direct monetary assistance for individuals and extra help for families with children During these negotiations, I fought tirelessly to ensure families, small businesses, and our health care workers were getting the resources they needed. I championed portions of the legislation that would ensure private insurance plans cover a COVID-19 vaccine without cost-sharing when it becomes available. I fought hard to put in place measures that would prevent drug shortages and protect our medical supply chain. I helped secure $3.5 billion in additional funding for child care assistance for frontline workers and made sure we are supporting our rural and telehealth programs. And I fought to secure more than $8 billion in critical funding for tribes and the Indian Health Service. But this is just the first step. As this public health and economic crisis deepens, I will continue to be a resource for all Minnesotans and fight for the needs of our communities. I will do everything in my power to work with state and local officials to ensure our families, hospitals, local governments, businesses, and community programs get the support they have been promised.

And when the House sent two articles of impeachment to the Senate, I took an oath to ‚Äúdo impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law.‚Äù That is an oath I take as seriously as anything I have ever done.  The trial wasn‚Äôt just about whether a president extorted allies for personal political favors and attempted to cover it up. It was about holding leaders accountable and defending our right to free, fair elections. And about the country we want to be and courage to fight for it. But a trial without witnesses and evidence is not a real trial. And an acquittal in such a trial is not a real acquittal either. Our duty to defend the Constitution requires action now. When the President solicits foreign nations to influence our elections with disinformation and prevents the public from hearing a full and fair account of that effort, we can‚Äôt afford to turn a blind eye.  There is nothing inevitable about democracy, it is something we have to fight for. And now, the fight for democracy and our Constitution has chosen us. We have a lot of work to do between now and November. Democracy is hard work. But I know you‚Äôre up to the task. This November, we can put our values on the record.

Mason looks concerned, probably because I was trying to break him of his attachment to the bottle he was so blissfully enjoying. The good news is that it was just water in the bottle. The bad news is that he was very, very attached. Adorable. 4.  And Archie. He is really adorable. He (and I) look so young! So much of the lives ahead of us we could never have imagined. Like that I would end up as United States Senator. And that Archie would end up with a prince named after him.
