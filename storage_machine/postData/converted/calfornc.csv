Cal Cunningham,,2019-05-17 20:30:41,"North Carolina is a beautiful State with a rich natural environment, but the quality of life we enjoy is under threat from many directions.  Our elected officials should be measured by whether we’re going to leave our State better for the next generation. In recent years we have faced two 500-year floods that have devastated Eastern North Carolina and coal ash spills that have damaged our rivers releasing pollution into critical watersheds.  Damage to our environment is also damage to our economy. Major corporate interests want to tack clean up costs onto our utility bills and are actively moving legislation to do so. With a former oil lobbyist in charge of the US Department of the Interior, now the oil and gas industry is one step closer to opening drilling off of North Carolina’s coast. As your Lieutenant Governor, I’ll be a leading voice in the fight against climate change and off-shore drilling.  I’ll be a voice for purposeful investment in the green economy and corporate responsibility.  The fact is, good environmental policies are also good job policies, now and for the future. This fight is personal to me.  For the last 6 years I have helped build and lead an environmental company that is taking on the challenge of landfilled waste and recycling.  My company has been ranked in the top 10% of mission driven companies in the world for the positive environmental work we do for communities. We can’t keep kicking the can down the road, leaving today’s challenges for future generations to inherit.  We are paying for the consequences of global climate change, bad policies and environmental degradation today.   We need change, and I’d like your support to be part of the solution.

As we see in the 9th congressional district here in NC, criminal misconduct can be ferreted out... with the possibility of new elections and people going to jail… What really stands in the way of free and fair elections? Over the last decade, Republicans have cried foul over “rigged elections,” stirred up fear of voting by noncitizens, and pursued “voter ID” laws under the guise of “protecting the integrity” of North Carolina’s elections. The fact is that these claims and policies are a distraction from the real rigging that’s been going on ever since they took charge. Why all this fuss?

Cal Cunningham,,2019-02-01 09:45:44,"Today marks the 59th anniversary of the start of the Woolworth sit-ins at a lunch counter in Greensboro. What started as four college students of color asking for service turned into a national movement.  Today also marks the beginning of Black History Month -- as North Carolinians, our history is fundamentally intertwined with the history of blacks in the South. It is also intertwined with the ongoing push for civil rights today. I was present on a brisk morning for the 50th anniversary of the Woolworth sit-ins and it was an incredibly moving experience. On February 1, 2020, I intend to be at the 60th anniversary. Today’s anniversary and the start of Black History Month are good moments to reflect on what it means to be a North Carolinian. I believe all of us are a part of this story -- black or white, gay or straight, native or recent immigrant -- that North Carolina belongs to all of us; we all have a role to play in fulfilling her promise and in making this the best place to live, work or raise a family. Today, let’s honor those who started a civil rights movement at a lunch counter and became catalysts for change. And then recommit ourselves to what each of us can do to continue the work tomorrow.",147,135,0,12,0,0,0,2,10151170983284990,calfornc,/story.php?story_fbid=10151170983284990&id=111428049989
