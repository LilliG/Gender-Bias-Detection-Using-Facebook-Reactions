"Johnny ""JJ"" Presley for U.S. Senate",,2020-02-05 22:08:45,"After watching the State of The Union last night, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some thoughts. This will be a long but important one, folks. Hold tight with me.   As a medical provider in Tennessee, I was thrilled to hear our President support keeping the ban on denying medical coverage on pre-existing conditions as part of the healthcare reform he envisions.  I support this policy 100%.   I support our President's call for a renewed focus on vocational education as an additional pathway to the American dream.  Not everybody is meant to go to a four year college and we have to recognize that is okay. America needs to make sure we are promoting multiple pathways to success including the trades. Throughout our history, it has been the Tradesmen that have built this country and made it great. Sadly, here in Tennessee, it seems these workers are the ones being left behind. That's not okay. I will go to Washington as a voice for all Tenesseans including those who feel they have been left behind.  We need all of the hardworking folks of Tennessee and America to KAG - Keep America Great!  I support The President's America First Agenda.  America is a great country but we need to solve our problems here - Healthcare, Veterans Issues, Education, Poverty and Infrastructure before we solve the world's problems.  We need to make sure citizens in Tennessee are treated at least as well as those refugees Tennessee is welcoming inside its borders.  America should never turn a blind eye to humanitarian atrocities anywhere in the world. Just like here in Tennessee, we have an obligation to protect those that cannot protect themselves.  At the same time, America cannot be responsible for changing or fixing every worldwide problem we see.  We must respect the sovereignty of other countries while using diplomatic pressure to work towards making changes that are practical and achievable.  Lastly, I want to state that I was disappointed at the rudeness exhibited by all parties at the SOTU.  That is not a behavior we accept here in Tennessee.  Regardless of Party label, and I am a Republican, I believe we need to get back to solving America's problems.  I don't care what somebody's label is, everybody should be using common sense and exhibiting professionalism when working, just like we do here in Tennessee.

God bless you folks!  https://www.facebook.com/1458819704427224/posts/2200130240296163/?d=nThe Patient We cavers get pretty emotional about rescues. The kind of emotional that finds a group of 40 people from at least three different states happily atop a windy and frigid mountain in White County at night in the dead of winter. We are busy with tasks. Rope must be rigged. Paths must be cleared. We must be trained on how to use a haul system. Inside the cave people are shaving rocks to widen the passage. Cavers are placing bolts to assist with moving the patient. A medic has rappelled and climbed to him and administers medication to ease the pain. Hand warmers are placed on him. He is cold from having been underground, and unable to move for so long. He hurts and is weary, but he holds a deep strength that all here know and admire.  Here is a place where normal people become heroes. Normal people learn the complex art of cave and cliff rescue and apply that to help their fellow humans. Normal people volunteer their time to their local rescue group. We wait for the order ‚ÄúSlow haul!‚Äù and hand over hand two teams pull the lines a man‚Äôs life hangs by. It is a process, with many steps to bring an injured person to the surface. We work and we wait. People within the cave are communicating messages to us about what we need to do.  Sometime around 3:30am the patient emerges from the cave. He is pale, but doing well despite the ordeal he has endured. I shout ""We love you!"" from above and see him crack a smile. Soon he is on the back of a side-by-side and on his way down the mountain. Cold and tired we pack up and find our way down to our cars. There must be a hundred people here.  Humans are capable of such beauty and wonder. If you ever doubt your fellow man, come to a cave rescue. Tonight a team of humans saved a life. I can‚Äôt think of anything more amazing than that.
