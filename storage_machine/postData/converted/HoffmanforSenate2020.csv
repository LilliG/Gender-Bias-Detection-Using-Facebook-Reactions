We have until June 30th to gather them all. We were well on our way toward getting the 800 required, plus at least 800 more -- when the restrictions caused by the coronavirus were put into effect, making it impossible for us to gather signatures in the usual way, either by going door-to-door or attending large gatherings. We were able to influence the state of NJ to extend us the same rights as Democrats and Republicans to gather signatures electronically. The instructions are below -- the whole process should take you less than 5 minutes to complete. Please help the Hoffman for Senate 2020 campaign's efforts by signing (if you have not already signed our paper petition) and asking your immediate family to sign. Please share this post to everyone you know, via e-mail, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and whatever social media platforms you use. To be eligible to sign, you need to be 18 years of age, eligible to vote in the state of New Jersey, and you cannot have already signed another candidate for US Senate's petition.

Assaf about Ramadan, which begins on Friday.I am mad. President Trump once again stokes anti-Muslim sentiments. On Saturday, April 18,  he maliciously retweeted anti-Muslim bigot Paul Sperry‚Äôs comments implying favoritism toward American Muslims compared to our fellow Christians. This tweet implied that unlike other faiths, the police would turn a blind eye to Mosques as they open for Ramadan and break the social distancing rules in place. Our mosques in New Jersey and elsewhere, like all other places of worship have been closed since the State of Emergency has been declared and social distancing rules took effect. Like all other faiths, we have resorted to having our prayers at home and online.  Our holiest month of Ramadan begins this Friday, and it is insulting and frustrating to approach such a special time for many Muslims with this type of anti-Muslim sentiment. All Americans, irrespective of their faiths have suffered in one way or another by the COVID-19 crisis. While other leaders have used this as a time to reach out to the masses, our President has elected to use his platform to amplify the hateful words of a known bigot. The President is yet again instilling anti-Muslim rhetoric into the public, rather than using this time to call for unity. The President could not be more wrong when he broadcasts the message that American Muslims are not being harmed by the current crisis, or that we would ignore the rules in place and endanger ourselves and those around us. As a community, we are hurting as much as anyone else. We are working the frontline jobs side by side with others. We are in every sector of jobs from health care professionals to foodservice. We have the same concerns over rent and other expenses. We are praying and mourning our loved ones. Many mosques and Muslim owned businesses have been at the forefront of distributing aid and supplies to affected communities. We are a part of the American fabric that makes us so unique and sadly, the President is trying to rip that apart.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1112135919147717,HoffmanforSenate2020,/story.php?story_fbid=1112135919147717&id=616156452079002

"Hoffman for Senate 2020,Madelyn Hoffman",,2020-04-18 12:10:59,"From the U.S. Peace Council:  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS SUPPORT ! Dear Friends of Peace and Justice, Please allow us to express our most sincere thanks to the thousands of activists from around the world who have signed this Open Letter. The response to the letter has been tremendous. Over 6,800 people have already signed the letter and many more signatures are coming in every day. This is a great achievement for our movement. However, given the gravity of the situation the world is facing, we need many thousands more signatures to guarantee that our voices are being heard. We are hoping that within the next few days we will be able to pass the 10,000 signatures mark. So please take a moment to sign the Open Letter to the Government of the United States and the United Nations if you have not already done so. We need send out as many letters as possible. Thank You! SIGN THE OPEN LETTER To the Government of the United States and the United Nations April 9, 2020 Dear Friends of Peace, Justice and Human Rights Around the World, The global spread of COVID-19 has exposed the illegal and immoral practice of imposing unilateral coercive measures (economic sanctions) by the United States government against more than thirty nations. The economic war against those nations had already resulted in unimaginable suffering of the people in the targeted nations even before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the devastation of the global pandemic, the targeted countries ‚Äî especially Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Syria and Zimbabwe ‚Äî are finding it prohibitively difficult to protect and save the lives of their citizens in the face of the ongoing global emergency. These sanctions constitute crimes against humanity. Instead of helping these countries fight the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of the United States is now using the public distraction caused by the pandemic to intensify its military actions against the targeted nations. It is increasing its threats against Iran and Syria by engaging in a silent buildup of its military forces in Iraq again, and has dispatched its Naval warships to the shores of Venezuela, demanding the total surrender of the Venezuelan government to the United States. Only a global wave of popular protest can stop these anti-human policies and actions. Please use the link provided below to sign the Open Letter to the Government of the United States and the United Nations, addressed to the President of the United States and Secretary General of the United Nations, demanding that all U.S. and UN sanctions against the targeted nations be lifted, and all U.S. military threats and actions against them be stopped immediately. We are dealing with a global emergency and must act quickly. Sanctions Kill !

Too bad I'm not running against him again, though I haven't seen Senator Booker speak up either against another war or against the inhumane, illegal sanctions. Call to Lobby Congressional Reps To End Inhumane, Illegal and Immoral Sanctions And War Threats That Prevent Saving Lives During The Covid-19 Pandemic Link to members of congress websites: https://www.congress.gov/members?q=%7B%22congress%22:116%7D&searchResultViewType=expanded&KWICView=false  Telephone Congressional Switchboard: 202-224-3121 Friends,  It is inhumane, criminal and immoral for the United States to be preventing certain countries from obtaining critical medical supplies to combat the Covid-19 pandemic while at the same time threatening new wars.  We urge you to call your Senators and Congressperson insisting they take action to change this destructive course. Write letters to the Editor or op-ed pieces for your local paper.  Below is some suggested wording to modify for your own use in letters and phone calls along with a few online references:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling because we are quarantining ourselves at home to prevent the spread of the corona virus and save lives. Yet we see that hospitals in the U.S. lack the equipment for our health care workers to heal our neighbors who have been infected, thus putting our nurses and doctors in harm‚Äôs way. That unacceptable negligence is very upsetting.  ‚ÄúEven more upsetting is that in the midst of this Covid-19 pandemic that affects every person in the world, the United States is actively preventing people in some other countries from getting life-saving medicines and medical equipment. Our government is using its economic power to block countries like Venezuela, Iran and Cuba from buying the life-saving equipment and protective gear that health care workers across the globe urgently need. Sanctions imposed on these countries are killing thousands of men, women and children. Allowing the virus and contagion to survive anywhere threatens people‚Äôs lives everywhere.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also upset that while you and I support every effort to save lives in the U.S. and abroad the Trump administration is now diverting resources and our attention from ending the pandemic to threatening war on Venezuela. The administration claims, against all evidence, that Venezuela‚Äôs leaders are trafficking illegal drugs. The Trump administration has placed bounties on their lives and is sending Navy ships to threaten war on Venezuela in order to overthrow its government and seize that country‚Äôs natural resources.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want another war. We want to save lives. I urge you to use whatever means possible to stop a war on Venezuela and end all sanctions everywhere. Let the United States be known for healing, not killing, our neighbors. Only jointly with our neighbors can we overcome this pandemic.  ‚ÄúWhat will you do to ensure our resources are used to end the pandemic, to stop these sanctions and prevent more war? ‚ÄúThank you. ‚Äù REFERENCES U.S. Peace Council Statement: The U.S. Peace Council Denounces the Trump Administration‚Äôs Continuing Aggression Against Venezuela People‚Äôs World: Despite pandemic, U.S. government threatens intervention in Venezuela Alliance for Global Justice:  US Places a Bounty on President Maduro‚Äôs head; US threats against accepting Cuba‚Äôs health aid NLG Lawyers Guild Legal Statement Against U.S. Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZhOEBfvrHheIoNwVIHgsNA248lXCSBfh-8k2fhIzOULJ4Bw/viewform Counterpunch article on new battle vs. Venezuela: https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/31/beyond-chutzpah-us-charges-venezuela-with-nacro-terrorism/ PeoplesDispatch: As the world tackles the Pandemic, the US charges Nicolas Maduro and others with drug-trafficking, puts a bounty on his head CodePink Petition opposing war on Venezuela: https://www.codepink.org/pandemicpluswar?

Hoffman for Senate 2020,,2020-04-01 22:10:43,"Thank you, Henry Lowendorf. The AP, link below, is reporting that Trump is now sending the Navy to threaten war on Venezuela. I urge you to contact your members of Congress to do what they can to stop this addition to the illegal actions, the economic war, the recent indictment of Venezuelan leaders on fake charges of drug running. This is urgent to do before Trump starts extreme violence.   <https://apnews.com/d4c51884ba3ac6a4311b6f548434f958 Dear Senator Booker and Senator Menendez, I see you didn't join 11 Senators in signing the letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin calling for at least a pause of the killing sanctions on Venezuela so that country can obtain medical materials to combat Covid-19.   President Trump is now sending Naval vessels to Venezuela. He is strangling Venezuela's economy, which is immoral and now threatening to start a war.   The indictment of Venezuela's leadership for drug running is both absurd and hypocritical. One of the US's major allies, Colombia, is the biggest source of illicit drugs to the US and the US government has not threatened Colombia's government. Trump's efforts to overthrow the government are illegal and violate international and US law. The US has a putrid history of overthrowing governments our rulers don't like with terrible consequences. The majority of countries around the world don't agree with US policy toward Venezuela.  Trump is starting a war to take eyes off his  incompetence in fighting Covid-19 in the US.  I urge you to promptly, urgently, introduce legislation or a resolution into the Senate denying Trump any finances to wage military and economic war on Venezuela, preventing this war of distraction and ending the immoral blockade of essential medicines.

Where are the voices in the U.S. Congress demanding that U.S. troops be withdrawn from Iraq?

Hoffman for Senate 2020,,2020-01-20 12:38:32,"In this speech that I found for the first time today, Dr. King addresses ""America's Chief Moral Dilemma,"" the triple evils of racism, poverty and militarism. This isn't the first time he discussed this issue -- a month earlier, Dr. King discussed them in his extremely powerful and timeless speech ""Breaking the Silence,"" given exactly one year before he was assassinated (April 4, 1967). In that speech, Dr. King also discussed the interconnection between these triple evils as related to the Vietnam War and called the U.S. the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today. Since that day, the military-industrial-complex has only strengthened its hold on the U.S. government and its foreign policies in ways very consistent with Dr. King's analysis. In other words, the U.S. is at war with black and brown people all over the planet -- through the use of military actions (undeclared wars) and economic warfare, in the form of sanctions. This includes most of Africa, much of South Asia and what the West likes to call the ""Middle East."" First, racism and profiling dehumanizes the ""other."" The enormous amount of money spent on these operations drains the U.S. Treasury and causes these targeted countries to become more militarized themselves in order to defend themselves. In the case of economic warfare in the form of sanctions, entire countries are smothered or strangled and thousands of civilians, including children, are starved and often die. People don't receive the services or programs needed to lift them out of poverty. Poverty is another form of violence against people.  Today, I am thinking of the tens of thousands of children of Yemen dying of starvation in a war led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the U.S.,  the children and others of Venezuela who are being choked by unilaterally imposed economic sanctions,  and the Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza whose lives are controlled by a brutal Israeli occupation backed by the U.S., but there are others. Remember the approximately 500,000 Iraqi children who died from unilaterally imposed U.S. sanctions and Madeleine Albright's infamous, horrible answer-- ""it was a price worth paying"" to a question about whether these deaths were worth it because the U.S. ultimately, illegally, unseated Saddam Hussein. Most recently, the U.S. imposed additional sanctions, unilaterally, against Iran -- while the House of Representatives voted to approve a non-binding resolution that requires the president to seek Congressional approval for military action only, saying nothing about economic sanctions. Check out this website for more information: sanctionskill.org. On this Martin Luther King Day, all our elected officials and military contractors should reflect on Dr. King's words -- but alas, we seem to be sinking deeper into a more militarized society that then causes other countries to militarize to defend themselves. Here, I am thinking of South America -- Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, and Honduras for starters.  It is long past time for this reflection and re-evaluation and time to take concrete action to change the direction of U.S.  foreign and domestic policies.",4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1042288259465817,HoffmanforSenate2020,/story.php?story_fbid=1042288259465817&id=616156452079002

Hoffman for Senate 2020,,2020-01-08 09:08:03,"I support and applaud the actions taking place throughout the state opposing war against Iran. The actions began immediately after the illegal assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soliemani and are now planned at least through January 25th, in a show of local, national and international opposing war against Iran. These actions show that the people of NJ, the country and the world are tired of U.S. aggression and see it for what it is -- a danger to the security of people all over the planet. Video from Iran showed hundreds of thousands, if not millions, take to the streets in response!  I also condemn the assassination of General Qassem Soliemani as an illegal act of war -- unsupported by international law. I take issue with those in the media and public office, including Senator Cory Booker, who sidestep this issue and say they ‚Äòshed no tears‚Äô over Soliemani‚Äôs death because of who he was, and want to know Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô for Iran, as if having an overall strategy would justify this illegal act of aggression. Call it for what it is -- and stop thinking that there is a justification for it. What if a foreign power decided that any one of a number of U.S. foreign policy experts had to be eliminated because the impact of their foreign policy was to kill thousands and disrupt the lives of millions? It would be illegal -- and would be condemned as such.   Enough already! Haven‚Äôt we had enough of illegal wars of choice that result in spending of billions, if not trillions, of dollars? Haven‚Äôt we had enough of living on the edge, wondering and worrying if a certain act of aggression will result in the use of nuclear weapons or conventional weapons that kill civilians and others just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time?  It‚Äôs time that the U.S. is held accountable for decades of military intervention and aggression -- since 9/11 and well before. ContinueHd demonstrations by the people are needed to show public officials all over the world that the U.S. government doesn‚Äôt speak for us all -- and that we are tired of these endless wars, the endless demands for money taken from other much more productive and beneficial purposes and that we stand with the people in those countries such as Iraq and Iran who have either already been a target of U.S. aggression or who are potentially next in line. The U.S. government should also respect Iraqi sovereignty and withdraw its troops from Iraq -- NOW!  Here‚Äôs a partial (and growing)  list of actions in New Jersey: Wednesday, January 8th, No War in Iran Vigil, 4 to 5 pm, Teaneck Road and Liberty Road Thursday, January 9th, multiple vigils in NJ, including Maplewood, as part of MoveOn‚Äôs National Day of Action Friday, January 10th, NJ Peace Action vigil in Montclair, 2 Church Street, 4:30pm - 5:30pm Saturday, January 25th, action in Newark, as part of an International Day of Action against war on Iran, 1pm to 4pm, at the Historic Courthouse, Market Street and Springfield Avenue.  It‚Äôs time that we the people show our elected officials that we‚Äôre tired of war, that we understand that war has a high cost in human lives, as well as robbing our communities of much needed money to address issues such as education, infrastructure, confronting climate change, improved Medicare for All, tuition-free college and so much more.

"Hoffman for Senate 2020,Madelyn Hoffman",,2019-12-15 20:40:33,"Please help me to call out Senator Booker on this upcoming vote. As far as I know, he has never voted against an increase in the military budget. He has also recently said that while he voted for the Iran Deal way back when, he will not commit to voting for it again. This bill makes it easier for the U.S. to beginning military action against Iran.This message comes from New Jersey Peace Action and Jeff Hoey, its Executive Director.  I need you to make a quick call right away.   As early as Monday, the Senate will take up the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  Stripped from the bill before being passed were the following progressive amendments: Blocking the Trump administration from starting an unauthorized war with Iran Ending U.S. support for the brutal Saudi-led war in Yemen Reasserting Congressional authority in debating and authorizing wars by repealing the 2002 Iraq war authorization Keeping new, ‚Äúlow-yield‚Äù nuclear weapons out of President Trump‚Äôs hands Limiting Trump from diverting Pentagon funding to build ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù on the U.S./Mexico border Stopping Trump‚Äôs discriminatory ban on transgender servicemembers This FY2020 NDAA bill has been so severely stripped of these crucial House-passed provisions essential to keep the Trump administration in check that it represents a near total capitulation.  To make matters far worse, the bill also authorizes a completely new branch of the military - the Space Force. It this is allowed to move forward, it will undoubtedly be the first step towards an new arms race for ""control"" of space.  Madelyn, this is an outrage and requires immediate action! Please take a brief moment today, call your Senators and demand that they vote NO on the FY2020 NDAA. They could vote as soon as Monday the 16th, so please call right away! Here‚Äôs what I need you to do: 1) Please call Senator Cory Booker at (202) 224-3224 and Senator Bob Menendez at (202) 224-4744. 2) When connected, here‚Äôs your script (or put in your own words): ""Hello, my name is (your name) and I‚Äôm a constituent calling from (your city). I‚Äôm calling today to urge (Senator________) to vote NO on the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that does not contain the House-passed provisions to stop U.S. support for the Saudi-UAE led war in Yemen, prevent Trump from starting an unauthorized war with Iran, and restrict new, ‚Äúlow-yield‚Äù nuclear weapons and creates a ""Space Force"". I look forward to hearing why (Senator_______) will or will not support my request."" This bill authorizes and outrageous $738 billion for the Pentagon with almost nothing to constrain the Trump administration‚Äôs reckless and dangerous foreign policy.

Thanks for taking action today. AS A REMINDER: The House of Representatives just approved this bill by a vote of 377 - 45, with only 44 Democrats voting against it.

Hoffman for Senate 2020,,2019-09-11 09:12:29,"This is 9/11/19, 18 years after the Twin Towers went down. Every year since the event, I have tried to assess U.S. and world progress toward peace -- a peace that would involve reconciling international differences and eliminating the use of war as a way of ""resolving"" those differences. It is distressing to report that 18 years later, the U.S. is still in Afghanistan -- October 7th will be the 18th year of that war (are we or are we not preparing to withdraw?); the U.S. is still in Iraq, a continued hot spot and one that seems to add fuel to the other at least 6 wars the U.S. is fighting -- March 19, 2019 marked the 16th year of that war. Then there's Syria, Libya, Pakistan, and Somalia, with repeated threats against Iran and Venezuela. And instead of ending the Korean War once and for all, there are still periodic threats of war being made against North Korea, a war that would be catastrophic in many ways, not the least of which involves the possibility of nuclear war. And yesterday, Netanyahu made a campaign promise to annex the West Bank should he win the upcoming election. What? Since when did international law permit a country that is already brutally occupying another and committing brutal acts against it to unilaterally announce that it would annex major parts of the other?  There's the on-going Muslim ban put into effect in the U.S. and the on-going battles over building some border wall that does absolutely nothing to address the reasons that people are fleeing their home countries. The worst part is that the real reasons for that flight are becoming more and more obscured -- as the reasons become more obscured, the ability to address them fades -- and the use of violence as a ""solution"" only increases. The world, 18 years after 9/11/01, is not a peaceful or just place. It is burning...literally and figuratively. But I am buoyed by those around the world who continue to work for peace, by first exposing the truth about how we got here and then resisting efforts of empire to further entangle us in this mess. These are the people who wage multiple acts of real resistance against the multinational corporations and their henchmen in government.

"Hoffman for Senate 2020,Green Party of New Jersey",,2019-06-19 11:29:00,"Today is Juneteenth, a commemoration of the announcement of the abolition of slavery. We must also recognize the US still needs to atone and dismantle systemic oppression.  The Green Party platform on reparations: Reparations for United States Afrodescendants (i.e., Black Americans, African Americans) The development of the United States has been marked by conflict over questions of race. Our nation was formed only after Native Americans were displaced. The institution of slavery had as its underpinnings the belief in white supremacy, which we as Greens condemn. In slavery's aftermath, people of color have borne the brunt of violence and discrimination. The Green Party unequivocally condemns these evils, which continue to be a social problem of paramount significance. The community of people of African ancestry whose family members were held in chattel slavery in what is now the United States of America have legitimate claims to reparations including monetary compensation for centuries of human rights violations, including the Transatlantic slave trade now recognized by the United Nations as a ""crime against humanity."" As our Nation has done in the past with respect to the Choctaw, the Lakota, the Lambuth, and more recently for Japanese Americans and the European Jewish community, reparations are now due to address the debt still owed to descendants of enslaved Africans. We commit to full and complete reparations to the African American community of this nation for the past four hundred plus years of genocide, slavery, land-loss, destruction of original identity and the stark disparities which haunt the present evidenced in unemployment statistics, substandard and inadequate education, higher levels of mortality including infant and maternal mortality and the practice of mass incarceration. We recognize that reparations are a debt (not charity) that is owed by our own and other nations and by the corporate institutions chartered under our laws to a collective of people. We believe that the leadership on the question of what our nation owes to this process of right ought to come from the African American community, whose right to self-determination and autonomy to chart the path to healing we fully recognize. We understand that until significant steps are taken to reverse the ongoing abuses; to end the criminalization of the Black and Brown communities, to eradicate poverty, to invest in education, health care and the restoration and protection of human rights, that it will be impossible to repair the continuing damage wrought by the ideology of white supremacy which permeates the governing institutions of our nation. While consensus is still evolving on what would constitute full and complete reparations, we support the following initial steps:  We support the creation of a claim of action and a right to recover inherited wealth and other profits accumulated from the slave trade for the benefit of a reparations trust fund.  We will initiate the repeal of the slave clauses that survive today in the U.S. Constitution.  We will work to restore lands stolen through a variety of tactics including: violence, terrorism and the discriminatory access to operating capital that together has robbed black farmers and the broader community of their lands.  We support the release of all political prisoners held by the USA. It is time that the political frame-ups, the prosecutorial misconduct and the racist application of police power that pass for justice in our country be buried and those victimized by these abuses of state power be given their lives back.  We will support existing Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as new and existing Education and Development Funds. We support efforts to overcome the effects of over 200 years of racial discrimination. We call for an end to official support for any remaining symbols of slavery and specifically call for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from all government buildings. We condemn the practice of racial profiling by law enforcement agencies, which are guilty of stopping m torists, harassing individuals, or using unwarranted violence against suspects with no other justification than race or ethnic background. We favor strong measures to combat official racism in the forms of police brutality directed against people of color. We support effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, including language access to voting. We oppose discriminatory English-only pressure groups. We call for a national language policy that would encourage all citizens to be fluent in at least two languages. [See section K. Immigration / Emigration in this chapter] We strongly support the vigorous enforcement of civil-rights laws, the aggressive prosecution of hate crimes, and the strengthening of legal services for the poor.",3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,873664139661564,HoffmanforSenate2020,/story.php?story_fbid=873664139661564&id=616156452079002

Hoffman for Senate 2020,,2019-03-06 08:01:21,"The events of the past few weeks show that the U.S. is hell bent on accomplishing regime change in Venezuela.  But not if we have anything to say about it! The next few weeks will be critical to the U.S. and global peace movements. We have already made an impact. We know that the U.S. had originally hoped to achieve the coup by February 23rd, one month after the illegal recognition of Guaido as the Venezuelan president. Instead, their plans were met with fierce opposition all over the world in over 150 cities in the U.S. and abroad. Many of National Security Advisor John Bolton‚Äôs plans were blocked, at least temporarily. However, there are disturbing reports of heightened US military operations near Venezuela and in the Caribbean. This includes US Air Force flights along the coast and US troop movements in Puerto Rico and in other Caribbean nations. So our work is far from done. The threat of escalation to direct US intervention remains imminent. There are two national marches before April planned for Washington, D.C.  Both will oppose U.S, intervention in Venezuela. The first is on Saturday, March 16th. It is organized by the ANSWER Coalition and supported by many other national and local  organizations. We need a good turnout to show our elected officials that people are still watching and oppose these blatant efforts by the U.S. government to engineer regime change in Venezuela, instead of honoring Venezuelan sovereignty. The NJ Anti-War Agenda and Hands off Venezuela, NJ organizations have already reserved a bus for that march and rally. You can make your reservations or make a contribution here, but please read to the end of this letter for instructions.  https://fundly.com/hands-off-venezuela-march-on-dc-march-16  Two weeks later, on March 30th, we will need to make that trip to D.C. again! We have already reserved a bus for that march as well. The march and rally on March 30th is organized by the No2NATO2019 Coalition (No2NATO2019.org). NATO is ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù its 70th anniversary in D.C. this year, while much of the world suffers from the death and destruction US/NATO wars have caused. A war in Venezuela would be NATO‚Äôs first intervention in Latin America. The U.S. will ask Colombia, now a global partner with NATO, to provide a corridor for U.S. troops to enter Venezuela.  The actual NATO meeting is scheduled to take place on April 4th, 52 years after Dr. Martin Luther King delivered his now famous speech ‚ÄúBreaking the Silence: Why I Oppose the Vietnam War.‚Äù In this landmark speech, Dr. King called the U.S. the greatest purveyor of violence in the world and spoke of the need to abolish the 3 triplets of evil, ‚Äúmilitarism, poverty, and racism,‚Äù if we wanted to end all wars. Exactly one year later, Dr. King was assassinated.  NJ participation in this March 30 event is being coordinated primarily by the NJ Peace Council. You can make your reservations or send in a contribution here, but please read the rest of the letter for instructions:  https://fundly.com/hands-off-venezuela-march-on-dc-march-16  The reservations for both transportation efforts were secured by Bob Witanek of NJ Anti War Agenda. Collection of funds for both buses are coordinated through a single funding website. Almost two thirds of the cost of the funds for the  bus for March 16 was raised within a week, thanks to yeoman fundraising efforts and strong support from participants and supporters.  . Another $600 will raise the remainder.  For the March 30th trip, about another $1600 is needed.  We don‚Äôt want anyone to be prevented from heading down to D.C. due to lack of funds, so your contributions, even if you can‚Äôt go to D.C. yourself, will help subsidize students, the unemployed, and those on limited or fixed incomes.  We are urging all supporters to make their commitments to participate in and/or support the purchase of seats for others today as we need to cover the balance of both efforts well in advance of the actual events.  We ask you to make a contribution today - even if you have yet to determine which of the two events you want to participate in. You can let us know your intentions and even earmark which of the marches you would prefer your funding to support.   You can purchase your tickets or make your contributions here: https://fundly.com/hands-off-venezuela-march-on-dc-march-16  Some of the choices are: You will attend one or the other march, so you can contribute now and let us know later which march you will attend once you figure out your schedule. You will attend both and contribute toward a reservation for yourself and any others for both.  You know which one of the two marches you want to attend. You are not sure if you can make either but want to make a contribution now to assure the costs can be covered. You can let us know later if you plan to participate. You know you can not make either but you want to contribute to either of the two marches, both of them or for the bus requiring additional funds to be raised. , The suggested donation for a reservation is $50 per seat, $40 discounted and further discounts for subsidized opportunities.

"Hoffman for Senate 2020,Matthew Hoh",,2019-01-04 00:07:43,"In the last two years the US has had military forces in combat in, AT LEAST, 14 countries.

Add in Pakistan and the Philippines and US troops have been in combat (killing and dying) in at least 18 countries since 2001.

Today's fast is a big part of my vision for 2019, a Yemen that is no longer at under siege from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia -- one where all have the food they need and the time and ability to rebuild the nation my tax dollars have helped to rip apart. Of course, Yemen isn't the only place my tax dollars have helped to rip apart. The list of such places is too long to list here. But fasting today will be a first step in 2019 toward using my energies to end the violent, imperialist policies of the U.S. So glad to be part of this effort and so grateful to March on the Pentagon and Bonnie J. Caracciolo and Cindy Sheehan for continuing to organize against militarism and imperialism.Here's to Madelyn Hoffman and Cindy Sheehan for fasting today in solidarity for the people in Yemen who are on the brink of starvation.
