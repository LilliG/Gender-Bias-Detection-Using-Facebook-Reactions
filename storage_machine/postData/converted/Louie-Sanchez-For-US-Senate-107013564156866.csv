In some parts of New Mexico, dangerous illegal immigrants are released to the public, after arrest, with no regard for ICE detainers that are legally filed for their detainment.  To be clear, these detainers issued by ICE are not an attempt to round up random illegal immigrants who are just going about their lives... they specifically target illegals who commit CRIMES.  “When does ICE issue detainers? Only when three factors are present: (1) ICE has probable cause to suspect that the person is in the United States illegally, (2) the suspect has been arrested on other charges, and (3) the suspect is in law enforcement custody.”  We must prioritize public safety and the rule of law.

Louie Sanchez For US Senate,,2020-01-09 21:09:49,"Friends,  Today is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.  These brave men and women put their lives on the line to protect our communities and keep us safe.  Every morning they leave their house bravely, knowing it could be their last.  As an owner of two firearms stores and ranges, it’s been an honor to have had the opportunity to meet so many law enforcement officers and call them friends. Their courage cannot be overstated, and they have my utmost respect. Unfortunately, Governor Lujan-Grisham has decided to push unconstitutional legislation that the New Mexico Sheriff’s Association opposes.  Just yesterday, she unveiled so-called “red flag” legislation that fundamentally takes away our God-given 2nd Amendment rights.  It’s shameful that our governor would choose to push this agenda during a week when we should be honoring law enforcement officers, not pitting them against our citizens and the United States Constitution. I strongly support our House Republicans in their stand against this proposed legislation, and I will always fight for law-abiding citizens to have our rights to bear arms.  I’m proud to support our heroic law enforcement officers not just today, but every day.  Please join me in honoring them and the immense sacrifices they make for all of us.   God Bless,  Louie",30,30,0,0,0,0,0,4,114030906788465,Louie-Sanchez-For-US-Senate-107013564156866,/story.php?story_fbid=114030906788465&id=107013564156866
