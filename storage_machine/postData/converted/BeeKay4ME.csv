This morning, I’m headed back to SCOTUS in hopes I’ll be able to get in for oral argument on cases of absolutely pivotal importance to the LGBTQ+ rights movement.  If not, I will stand with other LGBTQ+ people, all of us waiting to hear what questions the Supreme Court asks when they try to decide if we are worth protecting from discrimination. Someday, LGBTQ+ people will have enough decision making power to ensure that the value of our lives stops being batted around like a political pawn by cisgender heterosexual people who have no idea what our lives are like. I have a lot of privilege as a white queer person with a relatively stable source of income in a state with explicit protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity... but that could change if I were to leave Maine or accept a job with the federal government. On Sunday, I stood in solidarity with survivors. Today, I will stand in solidarity with LGBTQ+ people. I stand alongside my communities because these battles are mine, too.

One year ago today, I sat outside the Hart building chain smoking and trying to shake the feeling that there was nothing any of the other survivors I was traveling with or I could do to meaningfully influence our representation. One year ago today, I felt defeated before the vote was even announced, felt my insides twisting, felt like there had to be a better way. When I heard about the Be A Hero fund, I got a flutter in my chest. “Maybe I could... No, that’s ridiculous.” Over the next month, I started asking myself why it’s so ridiculous that someone with federal policy experience, a law degree, and a life that actually reflects median-income Mainers’ struggles would decide to run. I ran out of reasons not to pretty quickly. One year ago today, I took a stand and then realized that we need to go further if we want things to change.
