Lakes like the East Lynn and R.D. Bailey lakes bring tourists to areas that need the additional revenue to help Mom and Pop stores to survive.  We have eye witnesses of operations that send shockwaves waves into the water in order to stun the fish to the top where Bass are being removed.  The lakes that are being targeted are the R.D. Bailey, East Lynn, Mud River, Rockhouse and Plum Orchard lakes.  A few years back, you guys spoke of bringing Elk to these parts but failed to tell everyone that when you did you were going to block off major hunting areas locals have used for as long as they have been able to hunt.

Once the instructor found out who I was and WHERE I WAS FROM I was able to participate.

If you are draining the funds from a water project it means that some people may not be able to get clean water.  If you have your hands in the cookie jar then you are participation in corruption.  Did the people agree to give their tax dollars so you could take them???  This is a reason why everyone should participate in the budgets of local offices.  Are the salaries even?  Where is the money going?  These are questions everyone has a right to know.

Listening to the Epilogue made me ugly cry.  Face buried in my hands sobbing!   Sometimes when we are ripping each other apart over political differences we need to take a moment to remember Tod Beamer and the other passengers of Flight 93 that crashed in PA on 9-11-01.  Once the passengers of flight 93 learned about the attacks on The World Trade Center and the Pentagon, they came together and made the decision to take back the plane.  In that moment, they decided to sacrifice their own lives to save others.  They died without knowing they also unified and saved the soul of our country.  The soul of our country is in trouble again.  It should not take a terrorist attack for us to once again love and have compassion for each other.  We have to find a way to unify as a nation so we can move forward.    I know we all have different opinions about the reasons we sent troops to Iraq.  My own opinion has changed multiple times.  The Anonymous author of the book brought up a very valid point about Bush‚Äôs decision to invade Iraq.  WHAT IF??  On September 20, 2001 Bush said ‚ÄúWe would come together against the threat of violence from terrorists.‚Äù  What if he had questioned the conclusions of our own intelligence agencies when presented with the evidence that Al Qaeda was responsible for the attacks on 9/11?  What if he had referred to the hijackers as ‚ÄúVery fine people‚Äù or said they could have been from a lot of different groups? What if he had tweeted conspiracy theories about the attack that killed thousands of Americans? What if he had said he spoke to Osama bin Laden and that Osama bin Laden himself said he didn‚Äôt do it? What if he had said there was a potential for the US to have a great relationship with Al Qaeda and it would be a mistake to go after them?  What if??  I truly believe Trump is a symptom of things that are going wrong with our country.  How do we fix what is actually wrong?  How do we move forward from here?  We have lost the trust of many of our allies.  Our enemies have had 3 years of entertainment at our expense.  We don‚Äôt trust our elected officials.

"Richard Ojeda,Richard Ojeda",Richard Ojeda,2019-11-09 21:50:07,"This video was recorded during the Judiciary Committee (2017) where we were fighting to try and maintain a ‚ÄúWage Bond‚Äù in West Virginia.  What is a wage bond?  Well it‚Äôs a responsibility to any operator of an extraction company (Coal, Gas etc) to put a certain amount of money in an account so that if the company files for bankruptcy the miners will still get their pay they are owed for the days worked that month.   We fought hard to protect the pay of our miners but the WV GOP, WITH Friends??? Of Coal and the Coal Association pushed to do away with it.   Of course they had their typical BS reasons saying it would bring more operators into the area but in reality it gave operators the ability to not only keep from putting $$ up but allowed them to pull pitch and run while leaving miners wondering if they will get paid.   Miners are standing on railroad tracks in Harland County, KY because there was no wage bond.  Murray Energy is getting ready to file and I truly feel sorry for how those workers are going to be done.  When will we wake up and realize the industry has NEVER been set up to benefit miners.......it‚Äôs only been set up to give operators the ability to make all the money while dropping scraps off the table for the workers.  https://www.facebook.com/RichardOjeda2020/videos/1992230581010216?sfns=moMy loyalty will ALWAYS be with the working families of West Virginia!",159,133,0,20,5,1,0,7,2547387252161210,RichardOjeda2020,/story.php?story_fbid=2547387252161210&id=1375193652713915

Richard Ojeda,,2019-01-29 17:18:41,"So.......everyone remember that a month before the mid-terms, the Gov surrounded himself with all of his republican crooks and made the promise of another 5% pay raise and 100 million dollars toward the PEIA insurance for all teachers, School Service Personnel and State Employees.  The elected officials standing around Boss Hogg knew what they were going to do by adding other bills onto the education bill to either pass things that could NEVER pass on their own or kill the promise of another pay raise.  Remember....that is the plan.   The governor (Scoundrel #1) is now saying that he will veto it.  Why?  Remember it was his idea!  Because he now sees that he has shoved a stick into a hornets nest and he now wants to try to look like a hero when once again, he is the one who come up with this horrible plan.   Senator Carmichael (Scoundrel #2) is hoping the governor will approve this train wreck because in two years Carmichael will be challenging the governor for his seat. Carmichael has already proven that he has no respect for the WV Constitution.
