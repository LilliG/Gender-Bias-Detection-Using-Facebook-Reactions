DeMartino For State Representative,,2019-03-12 15:27:34,"Statemeant from James DeMartino Please follow Jim on his Vice-Chair campaign page James DeMartino for Delaware ""First and foremost, I appreciate the support that I received during my previous campaign for State Representative and respect our Chairman and his current leadership team. They all accepted a thankless and very difficult job. However, during last night's Sussex County meeting, Chairman Mike Harrington went on a 17-MINUTE TANGENT about his current campaign and didn't offer any new ideas or plan, but excuses of why we lost in 2018. This kind of talk is what brought us back 100 years.” #1885 ""We need to have a plan! That's why I support Chuck Boyce's plan to rebuild the party, from the infrastructure to the finances to communication, a message that all Republicans can accept. Making ""TEAM GOP"" slogans isn't a plan. If you are going into battle and don't have a plan, you will lose. As a former United States Marine Corps Intelligence officer, I understand how important structure and strategy are for any leadership position. Having a good structure in place will allow for our strategy to trickle down the Party structure and maximize Party support for every candidate, meaning every Republican can benefit from our Party, and our Party's values. I will bring structure and make sure that we, as a party, are following our own rules."" ""I believe in communicating an effective message, which will include strong support for our [2nd Amendment] rights and a [Pro-Life commitment] is necessary to unify all Republicans. We need to be prepared and unified entering the 2020 Presidential election cycle. As I said last night, we must support all Republican candidates, and not just focus on one Senatorial or one Representative seat. That was absolutely done during the 2018 cycle and that's why we lost strength in both the Senate and the House. We must use our resources better than this and reach out to the 198,477 registered republicans in Delaware to ask for their support, donations, and volunteering capabilities. As Vice-Chairman, as soon as I am elected the day after the convention, I will immediately start to makes pitches to the Republican National Committee, as well as Washington D.C. donors that I worked with, to ask for assistance in fundraising that will strengthen our position for 2020 and beyond. I look forward to touring across our state and meeting the many loyal Republicans and expressing my vision for what the State Party should be.""
