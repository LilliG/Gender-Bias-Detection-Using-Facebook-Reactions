"Aaron Pettigrew for U.S. Senate,Bonnie Bullington,Aaron Pettigrew for Senate",,2020-02-28 14:23:15,"I felt the need to share this for anyone who might need a more in depth look at Aaron Pettigrew.... Do you realize we have 12, yes twelve, Republican Candidates running for Lamar Alexander's spot in the US Senate? Other than Bill Hagerty and Manny Sethi can you name any of them? Of course most of them will never make it past the Primary in August.  The only two we have to worry about are Hagarty and Sethi. President Trump has misguidedly chosen to back Hagerty. And we know Hagerty has big money behind him. Hagerty, a man of big money and connections has nothing to offer We The People but empty words.  And Sethi, while saying he doesn't have the big money backing him, well that's smoke and mirrors. Those commercials are not cheap. So yes, there's big money there somewhere. Creative accounting maybe? And you can bet he has some high class connections of his own. He portrays himself as a ""working man"" because he's a surgeon. He has no concept of what a ""working man"" really is and will also only play lip service to We The People. Now enter Aaron Pettigrew. He's the only other Candidate who has a chance of beating Hagarty and Sethi, and here's why. Just because Aaron Pettigrew isn't a household name, YET, he has a LOT going for him. The fact that he's NOT a rich career politician is a big plus for Aaron. The fact that he's a ""blue collar working man"" carries a lot of weight as well. You see, it's the blue collar working people who know the daily struggles of trying to make ends meet from paycheck to paycheck, who constantly see their elected officials giving lip service to them, while in the background, helping only those who can offer them something in return. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, is very much alive and well in politics and We The People are tired of it. Of course we realize there must be some give and take in politics, just as in anything else. But for way too long WE have been the ones doing all the giving.  But let's get back to Aaron and what he has going for him besides what I've already stated. And here I'd like to go back to the day I met Aaron because it really does speak volumes for the person he is. Notice I said person and not politician.  A local Facebook Pro Gun Group was holding it's first Bar B Q. This was slated to be held outside on a beautiful day in May. It rained cats and dogs! Being the country boys and girls we were rooted deep in farm country, we weren't deterred. No problem! We'd move it into the barn! Granted, the barn was dry. But outside the barn was a wet, muddy world. Not knowing Aaron I was a bit concerned with how he would handle the situation. WAS I EVER IMPRESSED! He took to us and the situation like a duck to water. Pun intended! Within the first five minutes he was just ""one of us."" I kept looking for signs of discomfort on his part. It simply wasn't there. He joined right in and you could tell he really was enjoying himself. He got wet that day. He got muddy that day. And later in the day when we brought out our AR's, pistols, and shotguns, for some target practice, he enjoyed that too. Since that day I've been one of his biggest fans. But let me tell you, he's picked up a whole lot more since then. People relate to Aaron. And he relates to people. But now let's get back to his platform. Aaron is a Constitutionalist. He believes as we do, that our Constitution should be not only read, but followed. Not rewritten! And something that's very dear to my heart, Aaron is a strong supporter of our Second Amendment. He believes in term limits. Aaron also believes that when a politician leaves office, they should no longer benefit from having held office in terms of health insurance, retirement benefits, etc. And he's promised not to do so. He believes our voices must always be heard. One thing he has promised when he takes his seat in the Senate is to spend as much time in different areas in Tennessee as he can while not in Washington, to meet with folks and hear their concerns so he can work on the issues that needs to be addressed. Aaron won't just discuss said concerns, he will if at all possible find ways to address them and fix any he can. Aaron believes illegal immigration needs to be stopped. He's not against immigration. But believes it must be done legally. He also believes the refugee situation is out of control and must be addressed. Aaron doesn't have the big money like Hagarty and Sethi. But consider this, when he ran against Marsha Blackburn for Senate, he did so on a finance budget of only around $1,200.00 of his own money and still managed a decent amount of votes. That in itself speaks volumes for Aaron.  Granted Aaron has been a bit slow from the starting gate. But he's also been holding down his full time job driving a truck. He will soon be starting to work two weeks and take two weeks off to campaign and that's going to be a big help to getting his name out there.. But he also has a secret weapon this time around. It's called PETTIGREW'S POSSE.  You see, when he came to that Bar B Q in Northeast Tenn. last May people were so impressed with him and it lit a fire under us that has been unstoppable. That fire has turned into a Movement which in turn turned into the PETTIGREW POSSE, which is campaign volunteers working hard to get Aaron elected. Aaron had mentioned that he couldn't afford to pay anyone yet for their help and I guess we kind of took offense to being paid for what we believed so strongly about. If he came into a big campaign budget tomorrow I don't think there's a one of us who would take dime one for what we're doing. We'd tell Aaron to put that money where it would do the most good for his campaign. So what is The Posse doing for Aaron? The easiest thing we're doing is blasting social media with Aaron's campaign and telling everyone who will listen about him. We're getting out in our communities and campaigning and putting out his campaign signs. We're talking to our local elected officials about him. We're working on getting him spots on radio, TV, and in newspapers. We're setting up Rally's and Fundraiser's for him. It doesn't matter what needs doing, we're going to do it!   Most of us are either on a fixed income, or just struggling to make ends meet from week to week and we can't contribute much money wise so we contribute our time. The ones who can help financially do. One lovely lady who's handicapped and can't physically get out and about everywhere paid for 500 campaign signs, business cards, etc. Another Posse member paid for the rent of the building where we're holding Aaron's first Campaign Rally and Fundraiser in Northeast Tn this Saturday. I'm not telling you these things to beg you for contributions. Although I'm not above begging so YES PLEASE!!! But I'm telling you this to give you a glimpse of how the people working behind the scenes for Aaron feel about him. There is a Movement behind Aaron and we're going to move him all the way to Washington D C! So heads up everybody... Aaron Pettigrew is about to become a household name that everybody can be proud of. Aaron Pettigrew is going to become our next United States Senator!

For starters, the Constitution does not make room for a 2 million work force Administration and Executive Branch Bureaucracy.  There is some call through the powers of authorising a cabinet and to help the President execute the Constitutional Laws of the land but not this much, not to be a second branch of legislation itself.  The left, not just the Democrat left but even the Republican left have supported the expansion of the administrative State.  Regulations are only supposed to support the purpose of executing the law.  Being a non-delegationist means that this practice must stop.    I talk about tax and revenue being around 75,000 pages long, the law itself is actually only around 20,000 pages, which is still ridiculous for a society which purport all citizens to be equal under the law, the regulations are what make up the remaining 50,000 plus pages.  This has happened with pretty much every political issue that has come to the Federal Government's attention since before I was born.    Congress, both chambers, is supposed to author the law.  Most laws that get voted on by Congress are written by those same unelected bureaucrats, the same goes for the budget and more. Many are also written by lobbyists and PAC organizations, perhaps edited by Congress but none the less, the same applies.  Now because of all of the branches that the Federal Government has crossed into, there is no way one person can know all of it so yes a Congressperson from either chamber must have staff members to help them with different aspects of dealing with this problem but with that staff, if properly designed, it would still have to go through that elected official.  Most of our current crop of Congress would happily keep their staff primarily centered around P.R. but if you want a Constitutional Government, We The People can't afford that anymore.  They don't want people like me elected that will do just that because that means you will see it and begin to expect it from them.  I want you to, I want to show it to you.  Typical politicians are happy with it the way it is because they have time to throw the fundraisers, they have time to go to the Charity Balls, they have time to enjoy all the trappings and the State dinners and all those status symbols that currently come with the office but if you start to expect them to earn that salary, they won't be able to do all of that.  The only way to do that is to choose a candidate that really wants to work for you.    There is another more insidious reason they want to keep it that way.  Creating actual SOLUTIONS is taken out of their hands.  It allows them to keep coming back to you every two, four or six years with excuses but claim that they are standing up for you.  The delegation of Congress's authority is how things keep going the way they are and not going the way you vote for.    What I intend to do is take those excuses away from the people we send to DC for us.  I will do it by setting that example.  I will do it by putting the tools back into place that Progressive Congresspeople have given away.  That is what a non-delegation candidate is about!",7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,132807408240816,AaronPettigrewForTennessee,/story.php?story_fbid=132807408240816&id=109959947192229

"Aaron Pettigrew for U.S. Senate,Dave Lessa",,2020-02-13 22:37:31,"A Republic if you can keep it. In 1773 Americans got fed up with English Tyranny and the Sons of Liberty took action - We know it today as the Boston Tea Party In 1775, Americans got fed up with English tyranny and took action for the next 8 years - we know that as the American Revolution  In 1787, because Americans needed a government, Americans took action and concluded the Constitutional Convention. It was at this time we get the famous Ben Franklin Quote, ‚Äú A republic if you can keep it.‚Äù Notice we had just come through a decade and a half of war, and nearly 3 decades of either war or enduring tyranny.  In 1812, the English weren‚Äôt done with us yet and again attacked us. Americans took action, and defeated them once again.  Interspersed  with these major events were smaller events that proved Americans willingness to take action - the Indian Wars, Shays‚Äô Rebellion, The Whiskey Rebellion, Fries Rebellion, the Barbary Wars, the Texas Revolution, Mexican-American War, and Harpers Ferry, among others.  In 1861, Americans again, for mostly economic but some political reasons, engaged in action - the Civil War.  In 1898 we were involved in the Spanish-American War. All throughout this period, and even into the 20th century, the Indian Wars continued to rage.  In 1917, while remaining neutral at the time, American ships were sunk by German submarines, so America took action and joined the 1st World War.  In 1923 we had our last battle in the Indian Wars. In 1941, after being attacked, Americans again took action and entered the 2nd World War.  Americans took action again in 1946 at what is known as The Battle of Athens (Tennessee).  By 1950 our culture began to change. In the 60‚Äôs thousands of Americans ‚Äúdodged the draft‚Äù, drugs became more common, and God less so. While America was involved in conflicts over the next 6 decades, it was always viewed by the masses from a 3rd person perspective. Most were not involved. And over those 6 decades American rugged individualism gave way to victimhood, gender confusion, man buns and safe spaces.  But there are still hold outs, still throw backs to Americas original rugged roots. And so in today‚Äôs America, as socialism sits on our doorstep waiting for a crack in the door to slip through, maybe it‚Äôs time for those throwbacks to consider taking action.  ‚ÄúA republic, IF you can keep it.‚Äù Given all I have enumerated, do you think Ben Franklin was talking about dialogue? Voting? A war of ideas? Or was he providing his commentary based on his experiences of the day - physically fighting for what they wanted? You decide...  But remember this as well. Trump will only be around for 5 more years max. God may be using him to show us all how to fight again. To show us what courage looks like. To show us what it means to endure. To show us that we do not need to tolerate those things with which we disagree vehemently. We need to decide soon if we also have the courage, endurance, principle to take action, because when Trump is gone, there will be no time left for action. The old way will reassert itself. Corruption will grow stronger than ever. Federal and State governments will continue to usurp power the Constitution does not afford them.  ‚ÄúA republic if you can keep it‚Äù... never designed for capitulation, never designed for apathy and inaction. So if we ever want to move back towards the republic we had, to God as a nation, to all the good roots we had, we better be willing to take action.",5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,129830011871889,AaronPettigrewForTennessee,/story.php?story_fbid=129830011871889&id=109959947192229
