Texans For Stovall,,2020-03-02 13:05:58,"Dwayne here: Texans, I wrote this I a while back, and never did anything with it, so I might as well share it.  ________ What makes an every-Texan run for United States Senate? Answer: selfishness. I just want to be left alone, and I know this government will never leave me alone. My name is Dwayne Stovall and I’m just an every-Texan. I’m a husband, a father, and a business owner. I work for myself and my family. I’m charitable where my heart calls me to be. I believe a man should own the property he purchases with the fruits of his labor. I believe the governmental structure under which we relate to each other should be as small as humanly possible and should exist only to secure our individual liberty and property.  In short, I’m a little [r] republican with Jeffersonian principles, and that makes me the conservative republican that the establishment big government leadership of the Republican Party no longer represents.  What makes me different than most candidates is that I have a deep historical knowledge of this office; what it can do, what it can’t do, and its primary purpose - which is to protect the best interests of Texas at all times. Sixteen years ago I began studying source documents from the founders in Philadelphia, to the delegates in the State Ratification Conventions, and more. Early in this self-study I developed an affinity for the U.S. Senate position because of its original design, which was to be, as George Mason described it, “a mechanism of self-defense” for the States. It was during this time that I began closely monitoring John Cornyn’s behavior in office, and started understanding just how bad he was for Texans and the future of Texas.  It doesn’t take the casual observer long to realize that Cornyn’s actions in office are completely predictable. When and if he ever speaks publicly, which is extremely rare outside of an election period, it is always the same old rhetoric; “Those Democrats” are the ones who want to grow the debt. THEY are the one who want to increase the spending. THEY are the ones who want to fund Planned Murderhood. THEY are the ones who want to give the government evermore unconstitutional powers. This is his only message and it has never ever changed. The problem with his message is that it is a lie. When I say Cornyn’s actions are predictable, this is what I mean: He stands in front of the camera and blames the Democrats for things like increasing the debt, increased spending, funding Planned Murderhood, and government overreach. Then when the camera is off, he goes to the floor of the chamber and votes with the Democrats for things like increasing the debt, increased spending, funding Planned Murderhood, and government overreach. He spends millions of dollars each election telling every conservative Texan that he is “just like you” just before negotiating with Dianne Feinstein to create “smart” infringements on our right to bear arms, or working with Beto to craft legislation that undermines the wall, or voting for illegal bailouts, DACA, anti-free market minimum wage increases, and allowing the federal government to illegally spy on law abiding Texans. And these are just a few examples. After many years of watching John Cornyn consistently vote with the Democrats on everything we conservative Texans hate, and then listening to him blame the Democrats for the very problems he helped create, I made the decision to run against him. So, in 2014, with only 70k dollars, I ran against John Cornyn and garnered almost 11% of the Republican Primary.  I decided almost immediately to run again and never really stopped campaigning. I have the largest campaign in Texas with between 1,000 and 1,500 volunteers, who are all drawn to the message of “Putting Texas First” and the belief that we must divest power away from this federal.  Texans, young and old, know that John Cornyn is everything that is wrong with DC today.  He’s not a fighter. He’s the SWAMP.  We Texans deserve better - much better - and we deserve to be left alone.

Texans For Stovall,,2020-03-02 12:20:39,"Texans,  Having a family heritage of men who came here while this land was still Mexico, and who fought against tyranny for Texas independence, gives me a great admiration for this day in our history. It make me ponder the great sacrifices that were made to establish this wonderful State and to protect liberty. It also reminds me that today, 184 years later, liberty is once again under attack, and it is imperative that we respond. Yes, liberty is being destroyed, not by abrupt and abusive actions, but by silent and unseen consent; not with canons and other armaments, but with governmental policies and centralized power. As I write this, every aspect of the daily lives of Texans are ruled over from a distant town by people we do not know.  These are the same people who force us to be business partners with an organization that murders babies. These are the same people who use the government to spy on us without cause or consent. These are the same people who spend our earnings on things we do not approve of and then borrow more in our names. The same people who destroy our currency. The very same people who want to restrict our right to bear arms, and then expect us to thank them for it. From time to time throughout history, a generation is called upon to protect liberty. I truly believe that this is that time, and ours is that generation.  Brothers and sisters, divesting power away from that federal government and #PuttingTexasFirst has never been more important. We must come together to protect Texas - to protect liberty. We can. And I believe we will.  Happy Texas Independence Day.  May God bless each and every one of us, and may He continue to bless the great State of Texas.

Texans For Stovall,,2020-02-22 19:52:55,"The narrative being put forward by Munisteri, Rove, the RPT’s James Dickey, and their liberal friends in the media, is that the longtime establishment member of the swamp, John Cornyn, is unchallenged in the primary and is just “focused on November”.  That’s the narrative. This is the reality.  A huge number of Texans truly dislike John Cornyn and support for him is at an all time low, so low that he can’t afford to release a poll.

By now you should know that is complete BS.  For almost two decades John Cornyn has consistently voted WITH the Democrats to increase the debt, to increase the spending, to grow the government, and to expand its unconstitutional powers -  all at the expense of Texas and Texans.  We Texans can thank ""Big Government John"" for illegally bailing out private companies, for forcing us to be business partners with an organization that murders babies and sells their body parts, for a border that's not secured, and for this government collecting all our phone calls, texts, and emails, without our knowledge or consent.  While we're at it, we Texans need to be sure and pat old John on the back for working with Dianne Feinstein to create ""smart"" illegal infringements on our right to bear arms, and for working with Beto to craft legislation that undermines the wall.   So, yes, if you want Texas to turn blue, by all means, avoid the truth and vote for a phony republican and establishment senior member of the swamp like John Cornyn.  And for those of you who proclaim to know what's best because ""I've been a delegate to the State Convention"", who cares? I have been a delegate for years. I even authored two of the planks on the current RPT platform. None of the work we do matters if you choose to vote for someone like John Cornyn who doesn't give a damn about the platform or conservative principles. Seriously, our own State Party leadership is in bed with the establishment. Why continue to support this behavior?  At some point Texans are going to have to come to grips with the truth; John Cornyn is NOT a conservative; John Cornyn will NEVER stand on conservative principles; but John Conryn will ALWAYS compromise on them.  Good grief, people, snap out of it.  It's this mindset that is killing the Republican Party and destroying Texas. We have got to come together and stop the cycle. March 3rd, we can do this.

Stovall came in third in the last primary contest with Cornyn while only having $70,000 to spend against Cornyn’s millions.  Executive Director JoAnn Fleming said, “Dwayne Stovall is a man of deep Christian faith and is a limited government, pro-life constitutional conservative.  He’s smart. He’s bold. He loves our exceptional Texas.   He is a successful family man and businessman.  He does not need the trappings of public office to make his life meaningful. Mr. Stovall is challenging 18-year incumbent John Cornyn again because he believes Texas deserves better. We strongly agree.  “Cornyn’s Liberty Score from Conservative Review is an F at 33%. Conservative Review’s Liberty Score® grades members of Congress on the top 50 votes over a rolling six-year term. Cornyn is just 10 points above Sen. Bernie Sanders and 11 points above liberal GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, earning Cornyn the shameful place of the 9th most liberal Republican Senator out of 53.  Texans deserve better, but we won’t get it if we keep putting the same people back in office just because they have millions in campaign funds. https://www.conservativereview.com/scorecard/john-cornyn/ “Gun Owners of America rated Cornyn at 50% for 2017 – 2018 because he supports red flag laws and voted for the ‘Fix NICS’ gun control provision, which would send hundreds of thousands of additional law-abiding veterans & seniors (even those with outstanding traffic tickets) to the NICS ‘gun ban’ list. “Among scores of votes that are anti-Texas and pro-Big Federal Gov’t, John Cornyn voted for the Wall Street Bailout, to fully fund Obama’s Executive Amnesty, to fully fund ObamaCare, for Obama's 2012 tax increase, for Obama’s Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch, for piling up debt while funding Planned Parenthood, and for allowing  government to illegally collect our phone calls, emails and texts.  “We need a Senator who will put Texas first. Dwayne Stovall cannot be bought by lobbies and the US Chamber of Commerce, and he won’t be silenced by political bullies.  Dwayne will always put liberty principles over politics.  Dwayne is a principled disruptor who believes in a bold, strong, exceptional Texas – a place that offers opportunity for all and favoritism to none. “Why vote to re-elect 33% John Cornyn who won’t take the conservative position on the top votes in the Senate even half the time? For Texans who are sick and tired of the same lame excuses from Big Government Republicans like John Cornyn, vote to send a fresh, high energy voice for Liberty to DC – vote for Dwayne Stovall.” JoAnn Fleming | Executive Director | Grassroots America – We the People PAC",389,344,1,44,0,0,0,13,1445387192293533,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1445387192293533&id=468445316654397

A recent fundraising letter that went out from the Republican Party of Texas and signed by RPT chairman James Dickey urges Texans, during this primary cycle, to ""keep John Cornyn in the U.S. Senate,"" despite having several challengers, including Stovall, who ran against Cornyn in 2014 and pulled nearly 11% of the primary vote, finishing third, in a race with eight candidates on the ballot. Former GOP chairman, Steve Munisteri, was hired by John Cornyn to run his re-election campaign. He was also quietly hired by the RPT to manage state party outreach throughout Texas. Munisteri frequently makes stops in counties, combining his pitch to re-elect Cornyn and with his outreach efforts. To do this, Munisteri has used party offices and resources that are not available to other candidates. Stovall said, “In 2016 we hired President Trump to drain the D.C. swamp, and every conservative Texan knows that John Cornyn is a senior member of that swamp. For nearly two decades now, John Cornyn has proven to Texans that he will never fight for our conservative principles. ""Using Republican Party resources to promote the re-election of John Cornyn during the primary smacks of the same tactics used by Hillary Clinton in her 2016 presidential campaign to mislead delegates and bully other candidates. Conservatives know that these methods are, in effect, 'cheating.' When John Cornyn needs $10 million and manipulation of party resources to give him an edge in his campaign, that's because conservatives throughout Texas know he is weak and routinely ignores Texans while serving as a Senator. ""Chairman Dickey has blamed this incident on the letter being written in late November and on one of his staffers, but there is no excuse to promote one candidate and ignore the others, especially since I've been officially declared since last summer and officially filed since early November. That bell has been rung, and you can't un-ring the bell."" Stovall has been in business for over 20 years with experience in highway bridge construction as well as oil field services. He lives in Liberty County with his wife of 28 years and the youngest of their three children.

Texans For Stovall,,2020-01-30 18:01:27,"Texans, Dwayne here: If this makes your blood boil, good.  (Note: The last time I checked, the Primary hasn’t happened yet.) The picture below is an excerpt from a letter sent out this week by the Republican Party of Texas, signed by the Chairman, James Dickey.  I want everyone to understand how incredibly huge this Cornyn charade is.  Early last year, Steve Munisteri, a past RPT Chairman, was hired by John Cornyn to help manage his campaign. Amazingly, the RPT also hired Munisteri to run the statewide “volunteer outreach” program. (No conflict of interest here, Texans, just move along.) So for many months now the entire State Party has basically been used as a campaign tool for the Cornyn campaign.  And no matter how bad the approval numbers are, or how disliked the man is across Texas, the messaging has been consistent: Cornyn is unchallenged in the Primary, we only have to worry about those “worse” Democrats in the General, and the establishment supporting media have followed that narrative lock step.  Texans, it is truly a travesty how the establishment leadership has made a concerted effort to mislead and manipulate conservative Texans, to hijack our Primary election process, and to buy an election.  I call BS on the whole charade, and I’m asking every conservative Texan to call out those participating in this mass manipulation.  The main office number is 512-477-9821. If you are so inclined, let them know you want a fair and open process to the Republican Primary.   As a candidate who pulled double digits in the last primary, this is nonsense.

"Texans For Stovall,Dwayne Stovall",Dwayne Stovall,2020-01-04 08:27:20,"Ahhh. Memories.Awake in the middle of the night? Might as well do some research on the supremacy clause...      Big government lovers love Hamilton, but they argue against him. Big government lovers, people who think the supremacy clause in Article VI of the federal Constitution somehow establishes the federal government as an all-powerful overlord of the States regardless of the issue, tend to share something else in common; they generally love Alexander Hamilton. What makes that fascinating to me is that Hamilton was crystal clear on the meaning of Article VI during the ratification debates in New York: “I maintain that the word supreme imports no more than this — that the Constitution, and laws made in pursuance thereof, cannot be controlled or defeated by any other law. The acts of the United States, therefore, will be absolutely obligatory as to all the proper objects and powers of the general government…but the laws of Congress are restricted to a certain sphere, and when they depart from this sphere, they are no longer supreme or binding” Let's revisit that last part of Hamilton's explanation of the Article:  ""...but the laws of Congress are restricted to a certain sphere, and when they depart from this sphere, they are no longer supreme or binding” That ""sphere"" involves only the few limited authorities delegated to the federal by the States that are listed in the Constitution and nothing more. Hamilton even wrote in Federalist #33 - “It will not, I presume, have escaped observation that it expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the Constitution….” So, the next time someone invokes Alexander Hamilton to prop up some made-up notion that the States agreed to a National government with unlimited powers, you may want to inform them that doing that does little to support their argument.",48,47,0,1,0,0,0,2,1411367159028870,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1411367159028870&id=468445316654397

"Texans For Stovall,Dwayne Stovall",Dwayne Stovall,2020-01-01 08:39:19,"My message hasn’t changed... #PuttingTexasFirst #BuhByeCornyn￼After reviewing the initial reports of the federal budget designed to keep us from the “fiscal cliff”, learning of the higher taxes, increased spending, and the additional --ADDITIONAL-- 4 trillion dollars in debt, I wanted to share what I repeat over and over again while campaigning. When it comes to the Federal Government, it is over.  The politicians in DC will never --NEVER-- make the decisions necessary to correct any of the problems that are destroying America.  Our path to failure has been set in stone for decades, and it makes absolutely no difference which party is in charge; the results will always be essentially the same.   The Federal Government will continue to grow larger.  The debt and deficit will continue to grow larger. The relentless and unconstitutional overreaches of power will continue unabated.  The States will continue to give sanction to the loss of their sovereignty, and the people will continue to lose their individual liberty under the guise of security.  All these things will continue unimpaired by the same irrelevant Constitution that has not seriously limited the Federal Government in over a century.   People want to scream about the President, but the President is not the problem; the Congress is. These men and women take from us the fruits of our labor and spend it without regard for tomorrow. These people will not be affected by the laws they create to legally steal from the same people they are supposed to represent.  The members of Congress have been given a pass by a people so oblivious to their own history, and the principle of liberty, that they have been reduced to begging for a King. The individual States are no better. The long- time incumbent State representatives are generally well funded, and deeply tied to their federal counterparts.  The people of their State entrust them with their vote, and they repay them with debt ridden budgets that do nothing more than give ever more power to the Federal Government.  They do this for the opportunity to be relevant; to be a player in the lucrative game of politics.  They want the power to not be affected by the destruction that they know is coming. It is time to remove every longtime incumbent in our State legislatures, and return the governing power to the people of each State.  It is time for each State to revisit the relationship it has with the Union, and time for each of us to decide how much liberty we are willing to give up to tyranny.  It is time to starve the Federal tyrant. All I ask is that we all pull our heads out of the sand and come to terms with the fact that we are once again being led by an elite few in a town far, far, away.  Sound familiar?  The time to stand for liberty and freedom is upon us. God Bless Texas.",115,106,0,9,0,0,0,9,1408130022685917,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1408130022685917&id=468445316654397

He sought the advice of his uncle Jose Francisco Ruiz.  This was his response:  ""I will give you my advice in a few words, remembering the favorite expression of your worthy father, Bread is Bread, Wine is Wine. The die is cast, and in a few months will begin the revolution that will forever separate Texas from the Republic of Mexico. I feel a lump in my throat when I say this. I spent the flower of my life and freely shed my blood for the Independence of Mexico, and I would willingly do so again, though I am now old, could I see any evidence that unfortunate Mexico was capable of governing herself, or upholding the honor of her flag and her nationality; but I have lost all hope of remedy, and see nothing in the future but her inevitable ruin and degradation. I have military honors (you know it well), and receive a pension from the Government of Mexico. I will lose it all rather than go to Mexico and unite myself to the ranks of that oppressive army. Do not go to the Senate of Mexico, for you will only go to assist in quenching the dying embers of Mexican liberty; let us rather stay in Texas, and throw in our lot with our native State, which can never be worse than now. This is all I have to say."" Navarro took his uncle's advice and a year later, the two were the only native Texans to sign the Texas Declaration of Independence.",131,116,0,11,4,0,0,6,1404741936358059,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1404741936358059&id=468445316654397

"Texans For Stovall,Dave Benner",Dave Benner,2019-12-23 11:43:36,"And this...Today in 1913, The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson. One of the most deplorable laws in the history of the United States, the act allowed for a cartel of banks to establish a legalized monopoly on the printing of currency, assured the continual artificial manipulation of interest rates, and perpetuated the most inequitable and callous of all taxes – inflation.  Many of the founders were adamantly opposed to central banks for these precise reasons. Thomas Jefferson wrote that he considered such banks to be more dangerous than standing armies, and wrote that paper was the “ghost of money, and not money itself.” James Madison was equally disturbed by the emissions of paper money under the Articles of Confederation, remarking that “restraints against paper emissions and violations of contracts are not sufficient.” Under that system, the disastrous paper money experiment of the Continentals, along with inflationary state bills of credit, had produced an economic calamity. Roger Sherman made a motion in the Philadelphia Convention which would restrict the coining of money to the Congress and also prohibit both the federal government and the states from issuing paper money. Sherman considered the occasion to be an ample opportunity “for crushing paper money.” With very few friends of paper money in the convention, his motion was carried by a strong majority of eight states in favor. A few months later, Thomas McKean celebrated that the Constitution put “an end put on the pernicious speculation upon paper emissions.” The Federal Reserve Act was concocted largely in secret on an island off the coast of Georgia known as Jekyll Island, a property owned by JP Morgan. There, a secret commission of private bankers and Senator Nelson Aldrich drew up the proposed outline for the plan that would become the act in 1910.  The Federal Reserve has since monopolized the printing of money despite the Constitution’s explicit requirement that only Congress has the power to coin money and prohibition against paper emissions, injected mass quantities of fiat in to the market which has depreciated the value of currency as a whole, spurred numerous boom/bust cycles, and created unsustainable, artificial markets due to a massive series of mal-investments. ---------------------------------------------- Dave Benner is the author of Compact of the Republic, which covers of genesis of the decentralized US political system and the extent to which government has violated its original boundaries and orientation: https://amzn.to/2LIPFWD  Dave’s American History Podcast: www.soundcloud.com/dave-benner Dave’s Patreon: www.patreon.com/dbenner Dave's website: www.davebenner.com",190,112,0,6,8,8,56,15,1398617006970552,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1398617006970552&id=468445316654397

"Texans For Stovall,Dave Benner",Dave Benner,2019-12-15 15:13:42,"Great read!Today in 1791, the first ten amendments were ratified by the requisite number of American states. As stated in the Preamble of the document, at the time of the Constitution’s adoption many within the states expressed a desire to prevent “misconstruction or abuse” of the federal government’s power. These ten amendments became known as the Bill of Rights, even though various bills of rights already existed at the state level.  Prior to arriving at 12 proposed amendments to send to the states for ratification, the states listed various proposals for amendments in their original ratification documents, almost all of which were premised upon the idea of limiting federal authority in various ways. Skeptics and opponents of the Constitution did not want to take Federalist assurances at face value, and hoped the amendments would make the boundaries of the federal government explicit and unmistakable. Patrick Henry, George Mason, Melancton Smith, John Lansing, Luther Martin, and Elbridge Gerry were among them.  While many believe the Bill of Rights was an obvious addendum that was popularly supported by all factions, it was not. It was the original position of many prominent Federalists, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Roger Sherman, and James Wilson, that it was wholly unnecessary. This was because Federalists had promoted the Constitution in such a way as to guarantee that the federal government could only exercise the powers listed in the document, reserving all others to the states, and making the assumption of any unspecified power a bold usurpation. In his famous State House Yard Speech, Wilson claimed the addition of a bill of rights would be “superfluous and absurd.” Echoing this sentiment in Federalist #84, Hamilton asked, “for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?” Still, the Federalists acquiesced when overwhelming support for a bill of rights materialized in the states, and the ratification of several, including Massachusetts and New York, hinged upon its inclusion.  The First Congress allowed Madison to collate the list of amendments to send to the states for their consideration, and Sherman made the determination that those that were adopted should be affixed to a separate document rather than interspersed throughout the existing text. Although 12 amendments were sent, only ten were ratified by 1791. One of those not ratified at the time, which would prohibit alteration of Congressional pay until after the next election, was finally ratified in 1992. Ironically, what was originally an explicit list of prohibitions against federal power has gradually turned into an instrument regularly cited by federal judges in the interests of expanding federal power and regulation over individual rights. Whereas the Bill of Rights originally intended to act as limitations against only the general government, the federal judiciary now claims an overarching, supervisory power over the state governments as well.  It does so through a fallacious notion that the 14th Amendment incorporated these prohibitions against the state governments as well, a principle known as the “incorporation doctrine.” As Raoul Berger demonstrated definitively in his seminal work on the topic, “Government by Judiciary,” this contention is fallacious and does not meet historical or logical scrutiny. The federal judiciary did not even claim this power until 55 years after the adoption of the 14th Amendment.  ---------------------------------------------- Dave Benner is the author of Compact of the Republic, which covers of genesis of the decentralized US political system and the extent to which government has violated its original boundaries and orientation: https://amzn.to/2LIPFWD  Dave’s American History Podcast: www.soundcloud.com/dave-benner Dave’s Patreon: www.patreon.com/dbenner Dave's website: www.davebenner.com",85,77,0,8,0,0,0,4,1390876107744642,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1390876107744642&id=468445316654397

"Texans For Stovall,Dave Benner",Dave Benner,2019-12-12 14:21:55,"No matter what is taught to the contrary, this is a union of sovereign States, not a monolithic Nation State. #PuttingTexasFirstToday in 1787, Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the United States Constitution. The event was the culmination of a bitter fight in Philadelphia between delegates both for and against ratification in the state.  James Wilson, who had represented the state in the Philadelphia Convention, answered a number of written charges against the new framework in his famous “State House Yard Speech.” At this point, there were already rumblings of opposition to the document, as antagonists declared it would act to subvert state power and permit unspecific authority. Numerous others attacked the Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights, which would have the purpose of listing areas in which the government could never venture.  Wilson opposed a bill of rights because he believed it would be unnecessary and redundant. He claimed that “it would have been superfluous and absurd to have stipulated with a federal body of our own creation, that we should enjoy those privileges of which we are not divested, either by the intention or the act that has brought the body into existence.” In other words, since the general government isn’t given the power under the proposed Constitution to violate such liberties, it would be unnecessary to add a bill of rights.  This deduction was also in line with Alexander Hamilton’s reasoning in The Federalist #84. He wrote that under the proposed Constitution, “the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations.” Federalists generally agreed with the sentiments of Wilson and Hamilton, refusing to consider the bill of rights a necessity.  Wilson ventured to refute some of the common allegations about the Constitution, such as the fear that it would disallow citizens from receiving a trial by jury in civil cases. To this, Wilson responded:  “Let it be remembered then, that the business of the Federal Convention was not local, but general -- not limited to the views and establishments of a single State, but co-extensive with the continent, and comprehending the views and establishments of thirteen independent sovereignties…The cases open to a trial by jury differed in the different States. It was therefore impracticable, on that ground, to have made a general rule.” Here we have corroboration of the notion that the Constitution was a compact made by “thirteen independent sovereignties” that all had their own courts to try offenders. Wilson reiterated that “since there has never existed any federal system of jurisprudence, to which the declaration could relate.” As a result, it was unnecessary to write additional prose about civil cases. To the accusation that the Constitution gave the general government powers which were not explicitly stated, Wilson responded by declaring that “everything which is not given is reserved.” Wilson said that power in the Constitution is not granted by “tacit implication, but from the positive grant expressed in the instrument of the union.” Therefore, a power had to be enumerated in the Constitution to be a legitimately used by the general government. This understanding was made explicit by proponents of the Constitution well before the Tenth Amendment reiterated the same.  Responding to Brutus’ implication that the Constitution would eradicate the state governments, Wilson said that “the existing union of the States, and even this projected system is nothing more than a formal act of incorporation.” Therefore, the states were still sovereign, much like the Articles of Confederation acknowledged. To the claim that the Constitution allowed for a standing military presence in times of peace, Wilson assured naysayers that “every principle of policy must be subverted, and the government must declare war, before they are prepared to carry it on.” Wilson also actively worked to refute the statements of “An Old Whig,” an opponent of the Constitution in Pennsylvania. An Old Whig warned his state not to adopt the new model because it would “totally annihilate, the separate governments of the several states.” As a result of the loss of state sovereignty, An Old Whig explained that the Constitution would give Congress the cause to “steadily pursue the acquisition of more and more power to themselves and their adherents.” The writer foresaw imminent doom: “The cause of liberty, if it be now forgotten, will be forgotten forever.”  Despite An Old Whig’s arguments, Wilson brought forth full repudiation of the allegations. Wilson’s words were particularly convincing in the minds of supporters, and there is evidence that he swayed some divergent minds in favor of the model. Wilson’s narrative certainly framed the understanding of the Constitution in Pennsylvania, and Federalists in other states adopted Wilson’s viewpoints and applied them in their own conventions. Wilson’s arguments produced several responses, including those made by an opponent using the pseudonym “Centinel.” Centinel warned of a scenario that would unfold where the general government could regulate the individual liberty of the people. He wrote that the general government would “restrain the printers, and put them under regulation.” He pointed to Article VI of the Constitution to explain that every power would be subject to the power of Congress. Centinel also highlighted Article II of the Articles of Confederation as an underlying maxim, noting that the states retained their sovereignty, freedom, and independence. He warned that under the new Constitution, states would not be able to do so.  In the western counties of Pennsylvania, tides were strongly on the side of opposition to the Constitution. Despite the widespread hesitation, the Federalists worked to alter state districts to ensure a favorable outcome in the convention. The new districts operated to systematically destroy much of the dissent. This factor, combined with the dedication of prominent Pennsylvanians like Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson, Gouverneur Morris, and Robert Morris, there was enough political influence on the side of the Constitution to carry ratification.  Ultimately, the combined efforts of An Old Whig, Centinel, other oppositional writings, and opponents in the convention were not enough to thwart the model. Ultimately, the Constitution was approved in Pennsylvania by a margin of 46 to 23. Through this act, Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify, and Wilson’s speech, unlike The Federalist, was highly distributed outside of the state. Federalists in several states adopted its main points for their own circumstances, making it one of the most influential cases for ratification. ---------------------------------------------- Dave Benner is the author of Compact of the Republic, which covers of genesis of the decentralized US political system and the extent to which government has violated its original boundaries and orientation: https://amzn.to/2LIPFWD  Dave’s American History Podcast: www.soundcloud.com/dave-benner Dave’s Patreon: www.patreon.com/dbenner Dave's website: www.davebenner.com",107,97,0,10,0,0,0,3,1387848681380718,TexansForStovall,/story.php?story_fbid=1387848681380718&id=468445316654397
