"Stanley Adair For Senate,Stanley Adair",Stanley Adair,2019-08-26 11:01:23,"The Killing Fields in America-Mass Shootings -Stanley Adair-U.S. Senate Candidate- I have been asked to write my thoughts on Gun violence in America and what I think would help correct this problem. First let me say, My Heart and Prayers go out to the families of all those that lost love ones in these senseless acts. I am not in no way trying to glorify these acts. These shootings are happening at an alarming rate and I feel that America is losing its way. I know every time a shooting of this kind takes place everyone wants to know, “How are we going to fix this problem?” The first thing some will say, “we must ban all guns or certain types of Guns” but I disagree. We have had guns in America for two hundred plus years and without Guns we would not be a Country today.  Guns have always played an important part of our lives in America. I do however understand that, to all those that have lost love ones in these shootings may feel different about this issue. However, I ask the question. When someone that is killed by a drunk driver with an automobile, “should we ban all vehicles or certain types?” The answer is no.   It is not the car that is to blame it is the driver of the vehicle. Just like the Gun, It’s not the Gun, It’s the person behind the Gun. The taking of a life is a cowardly act and, in most cases, it is a mentally unstable or radical person with no re-guard for Human life.   Banning certain Guns will not solve this problem. We as a nation must protect our citizens while protecting our Freedoms and protecting our rights as individuals. We must protect our Schools, places of Worship, Malls, Theaters, Night clubs etc. We cannot protect our Country without Guns. People bent on doing harm are the ones that must be stopped! I don’t have all the answers however we cannot afford to continue to travel down a road that I call the “KILLING FIELDS IN AMERICA.” I think background checks with emphasis on mental stability, but we must be careful and not take away the rights of law-abiding Citizens in the process. The Gun is a part of American history and we cannot afford to lose our rights to keep and bear arms. I believe we have a breakdown of the traditional family in America, and the consequences are devastating to our Society. This I believe is one of the most important things facing America. We cannot go back to a simpler time or place to start over, but we can move forward.      Our Nation has turned from God, taken prayer out of Schools and allowed other forms of Ideologies’ to now become common place in our Society. We once were a God-fearing Nation that stood on the Founding Principles of Our Forefathers. I ask the question? Where will we be in the next thirty years? Will we still remember the words “IN GOD WE TRUST?” We must as a Nation turn back to GOD. My hope is that America will rise to ever challenge and that these Killing Fields will end. -Stanley Adair - U.S. Senate Candidate 2020",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,702166743565935,AdairForSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=702166743565935&id=637801703335773
