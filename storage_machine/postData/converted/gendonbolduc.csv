Like any parents, Sharon and I constantly fear for the health and welfare of our children. But here‚Äôs the thing. During my 33 years in the U.S Army, I spent 81 months serving in Special Forces in various theaters of combat. But not once did I punish a firearm for pulling its own trigger. As politics continues to stand in the way of solutions, we continue to fail our children. We cannot legislate our way out of this problem, and I have seen first-hand what happens when a government disarms its citizens. We can do better, and it starts with leadership.
