Erik Underwood for Colorado,,2020-03-07 12:21:36,"Today is Caucus! The Denver Post has some great quotes from me regarding SB 163. We have to keep the momentum going and the heat on. Check out the article.  I want thank Leslie Scott, the parent who I met in Longmont at a Democratic U.S. Senate forum back in January. She asked me a simple question as I went around the room shaking hands; ""Would you ever stand in between a mother who wants to protect her child from harmful vaccines? I immediately said, ""No, please tell me more about your concerns"". I connected with Leslie as a human being and fellow Coloradan. I gave Leslie an answer from my heart.  I did not poll test my response before I gave her an answer. That is how I got involved in this fight. This is how I will work for you in the U.S. Senate. I will show up for you. I also want to thank Phil Silberman from Colorado Health Choice Alliance who supported my involvement.  I plan to testify in the State House against SB 163 as soon as they set a hearing. Please wish me luck today! We have our fingers crossed for great results across this great State of Colorado. - Erik #leanonerik http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/DenverPost/shared/ShowArticle.aspx?doc=TDP%2F2020%2F03%2F06&entity=Ar01402&sk=36815AA0&mode=text",61,29,0,32,0,0,0,8,2560763024245194,Erik4CO,/story.php?story_fbid=2560763024245194&id=1600562666931906

Erik Underwood for Colorado,,2020-03-02 10:42:52,"I met Jamel Holley last night. An impressive State Rep. from New Jersey who is here to lend his voice to stop SB 163. Rep. Holley was the lone Dem who killed a similar bill in his State. I’m the only notable Democrat in this State who is speaking out at great risk. Even though SB 163 is a State issue, as I am running for U.S. Senate, I will do what I can. This is a tight week as Caucus is this Saturday @2pm Statewide. I really hope you get out the vote this Saturday.  I cannot stress enough, watch out who you are electing to office, any blue just won’t do! Unfortunately a lot of our Dems are beholden to Big Pharma. . - Erik",155,77,0,78,0,0,0,35,2556510281337135,Erik4CO,/story.php?story_fbid=2556510281337135&id=1600562666931906
Erik Underwood for Colorado,,2020-03-01 19:22:32,"Caucus for Erik Underwood this Saturday & Send A Message Against SB 163 Statewide On Saturday March 7th @2pm, Let Your Voice Be Heard Against SB 163 at Your Local Caucus Precinct!  Become A Committed Underwood Delegate for U.S. Senate! Democrats, I need your help to help to get me on the ballot here in Colorado. In order to defeat Bills like 163 and other discriminatory bills that take away parental rights, I need you to Caucus for me on Saturday, March 7th @2pm. Do not let your children down, show up! Help me to remind our party that this is still our democracy and we will not be manipulated by Big Pharma in order to increase their bottom-line.  In three steps, become a Delegate for me at your local voting precinct, then onto your County Assembly, and then cast your final vote for me at the State Assembly on April 18, 2020. If you want to shock the world, and send a message to our State leadership about the harms of SB 163, then give me 2 hours on Saturday March 7th, @2PM at your local caucus precinct. This is how we get organized on a political level. This is how change happens.  You have to get involved in this process to nominate and elect someone who is going to speak truth to power and someone who says no to Big Pharma. I have a track record of being a man of my word and that word starts with integrity. I promise if you come out for me that hope will rise again; change will be around the corner. Step 1. What is a Caucus? It’s you, going to your local caucus precinct with your family, and neighbors; having a discussion with the people in your precinct on why I am your choice for U.S. Senate. Here is a link to help you find your local caucus precinct (You can preregister right now!), www.coloradodems.org/2020-caucus-locations/ . Next, a vote is taken among the people in your precinct to select a Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate. You must advocate strongly for me when caucusing! All of the other Democratic Senate Candidates support SB 163!  Step 2. The more votes I get at your local caucus precinct, will covert you and others in becoming Underwood delegate(s), which are committed to me at your County Assembly (See Specific Individual County Assembly Dates on www.coloradodems.org/2020-county-assembly-and-convention-locations/ ). This is how you become a delegate for me at your local caucus precinct. This is important because there is strength in numbers, and I need you to get your neighbors and friends out to the caucuses on Saturday March 7th.  ***Please call, text, and share this post and get our people out on Saturday March 7th! Help me to send a message to our Democratic leadership that you matter and that SB 163 is wrong and has no place in the Democratic Party! Step 3 – Final Step. On April 18th, 2020, The State Democratic Party will hold an Assembly Convention (Colorado Convention Center -700 14th St, Denver, CO 80202 Denver). You and other committed Underwood Delegates will cast a final vote to officially place me on the June 30th Primary ballot for U.S. Senate. I must reach 30% of the vote, otherwise, I will not make the June 30th Ballot. I am trusting that you will show up for me this Saturday (March 7th @ 2pm), because I have shown up for you. If I have the courage to speak out against SB 163, then have the courage to show up and help me win the Caucus. ***Call to Action***. I am counting on your support. I’m the only statewide and notable Democrat who is against SB 163. I want to fight for you in the U.S. Senate and protect your parental and consumer rights. If SB 163 becomes law under our Democratic Party, then what next? This Bill is scary and dangerous. Just give me 2 hours this Saturday @2pm. Caucus as if your freedom of choice, family life, and rights depend on it! Think about your children. This is how change happens. Stand with me. Go Make phone calls to your friends and neighbors or shoot out texts right now all around this State, even if you are not a Democrat, because this affects you too. We have to turn out the vote! I cannot do this this without your help and involvement! Democracy starts right here and right now on the grass roots level. I will be a U. S. Senator who you can lean on. Please do not quit our party, because I’m not done fighting for you. All I ask is that you show up with your friends and neighbors all around this State on March 7th, so they can hear from all of us loud and clear. We can win this!!! I need a big turn out all over this State. We can win the Caucus preference poll! If 25, 000 or 30, 000 Dem Coloradans show up for me, then we win the Poll! Please use the hashtag #leanonerik on any social media platform.  At every local caucus precinct, I can have (1) representative to speak for 2 minutes before the caucus begins at your location on why you are supporting me. Anyone supporting me has my permission to speak on my behalf as a supporter. Just talk to the Precinct Captain when you arrive at your location. I am also including a screenshot of my bio and other issues on my platform. Please take this information with you and feel free to reference it.

Erik Underwood for Colorado,,2020-02-28 15:45:06,"I am sad to learn that Colorado SB 163 is one step closer in becoming law. This Bill has so many nuances and unintended consequences that will affect many Coloradans. For example, this Bill forces parents to watch a one sided video if parents want to opt out vaccinating their child/children. That tactic is eerily similar to recent attempts to force women to watch a video when excising the right to choose. My fellow Democrats, this is not what our party represents. I never thought Democrats within my own party would stipulate a measure like that; this greatly concerns me. It also concerns me that the pharmaceutical industry is behind SB 163. I have met parents and a medical doctor that were harmed by certain vaccines.  These parents and medical professionals want greater transparency and accountability when it comes to vaccine makers, and want the pharmaceutical industry to release hidden studies/statistics on the type of side effects that these vaccines give to patients. This should be a easy common sense request. I stand with these parents and medical professionals who are against SB 163. This bill makes it harder for parents who have great concern over vaccine injury to opt out. When I was a kid I received 4 vaccine shots that included a polio vaccine shot. Now, from the time a baby is born to 18 years old, vaccine makers recommend over 50 scheduled vaccinations per person. It is a multi-billion dollar industry with no accountability and no liability. Last week, I submitted written testimony against SB 163 at our State Capital and stood with parents at the hearing who are greatly concerned about their children and their rights.  I pledge, if elected to the U.S. Senate that I will hold these vaccine makers accountable and look at new laws protecting people who are injured from these vaccines. - Erik Underwood     http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/DenverPost/shared/ShowArticle.aspx?doc=TDP%2F2020%2F02%2F28&entity=Ar00606&sk=6D05717F&mode=text",293,147,1,112,6,24,3,111,2554237694897727,Erik4CO,/story.php?story_fbid=2554237694897727&id=1600562666931906

Erik Underwood for Colorado,,2020-01-24 16:42:40,"Hello everyone! I'm sure a lot of you either heard of read the Denver Post article the other day. Yes, I'm running for U.S. Senate! There were a lot of things that bothered me in this race before I jumped in. I believe I'm the only one strong enough to shift the conversation in order to win the nomination. Democratic Senator Chris Coons (Delaware) actually in part inspired me to run, regarding his comments from September 2019. "" I want to believe of our country and ourselves that a more diverse Senate that includes women’s voices, and voices of people of color, and voices of people who were not professionals but, you know, who grew up working class and were the first in their family to go to school and so forth, that we can engage those voices and that they can be part of the debate, and that doesn’t produce irreconcilable discord. I think history may judge otherwise...."" - Chris Coons https://splinternews.com/this-chris-coons-comment-on-divers… I was outraged when I saw the video of his comments and I wanted to take action. Of course Senator Coons tried to clean it up after he caught some heat, but I believe there are a lot of people on our side and on the Republican side who feel this way (in Congress and in the U.S.Senate). I have built up a lot of respect here in Colorado. I'm hopeful that Senator Coons will be wrong in this election. Especially here in Colorado. I appreciate his honesty, but he is wrong and it is very hurtful. It wasn't a Trump supporter who made those comments, it was one of our own. While I'm sure he is more comfortable with the ""chosen one"" over someone like myself; If elected, I will look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, ""Let's get to work for our Country"". I may not ever be able to change someone's heart who believes that, but what I can do is help change the way the Senate looks. We have a long way to go, but I will try and do my part because I'm called to do so.
