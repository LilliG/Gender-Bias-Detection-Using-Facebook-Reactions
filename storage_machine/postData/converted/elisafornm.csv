Ben Ray Luj√°n‚Äôs 100% pro-abortion voting record means:  refusing to vote to end infanticide, voting to keep abortion up-to-birth legal for ANY reason, voting for millions of dollars in forced taxed payer funding of abortion organizations. This isn‚Äôt a party-line issue in New Mexico. Democrat State Senators in Ben Ray Lujan's own district voted against NM's proposed abortion up-to-birth legislation #HB51. It was a historic defeat that I helped bring Democrats and Republicans together to vote for New Mexico's values. The socialist Democrats at NARAL should understand that the extremist is Ben Ray Lujan.  He does not reflect New Mexico's values.
