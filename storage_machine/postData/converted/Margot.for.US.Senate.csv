Margot for US Senate,,2020-01-29 15:45:29,"Hi, my name is Margot Dupre, I am running for US Senate as a Republican against Cory Gardner in 2020 primary June 30th. My platform points are: 1) Political corruption, term limits, campaign finance 2) Stomping out child abuse 3) Meet with and listen to all the people of Colorado I believe corruption in government is the #1 issue we face today. On both sides, career politicians, lobbyists, and foreign leaders pillage our great nation. They coordinate in putting on a show, pitting us against each other with emotionally charged trigger issues, and sit on their hands pretending that their dysfunction is an accomplishment. I believe ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù must take a stand against politicians who take money and/or favors for special interest groups and foreign powers. I promise: 1. I will cut Federal Government in half! State government needs to take back most of the responsibility the Federal government has been forced to assume. 2. I will close the loopholes where politicians get rich off taking money for political favors. 3. Demand term limits we've been talking about for 30+ years I was told political candidates spend as much as $250,000 to just get signatures to be on the ballot. This, and other, financial hurdles completely prohibits average Americans from running for office. I envision a government run by people and not industry giants. I am running to stop the stranglehold big money has on our government. Stand with me in making our governing officials behave like the public servants they are. I want to hear from all 6 million Colorado residents. Whatever your age, occupation or lack thereof, education, color of skin, criminal status, etc. You are who I represent and I take that seriously. I am a PUBLIC SERVANT as a US Senator and I don't look at that responsibility lightly. I promise: 1. To be the best ""servant"" I can be. 2. To have town hall meetings regularly throughout the State. 3. To listen. Stomping out child abuse in American. This is my ""why"". I promise: 1. Stomp out child abuse in foster care. 2. Stomp out human trafficking. 3. Stomp out abortion from the onset of pain receptors. We have way too many children in foster care that linger for years are not adoptable. I will fight to make it Federal law that when a child is taken by ‚Äúchild protective services‚Äù you have 6 months to prove you want that child. During and after, there will be no visits, no holding the hand(guiding) of the biological parents, and no relatives popping out of the woodwork after the 6-month date. Immediate movement to terminate familial rights and adoption by the 12th month. Human trafficking is a disgrace to America. When we can find one person on the planet in a desert and kill him yet we can't find all the children being held in houses, back yards, etc. we are part of the problem. WE CAN FIND THEM AND WE WILL! Abortion in the 20th century is absolute mayhem. We are very aware of the gestation at which a human can feel pain in the womb and we are still causing unthinkable pain on innocent children. That is coming to an end!  Stand with me! Donate to my campaign at Wells Fargo!
