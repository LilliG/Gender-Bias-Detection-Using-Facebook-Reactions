"Lummis for Wyoming,Ranch & Rodeo Roundup",,2020-01-06 17:58:21,"Talk about a #ThrowbackThursday: My first job out of college was working for Cotton Rosser and the Flying U Rodeo Company.  A modern day Buffalo Bill Cody. A true showman of the spirit of the American West.Just got off the phone with my friend Cotton Rosser, Cotton has  inspired so many people including myself, and continues to do so at the young age of 91.   Here is a story that was done on Cotton last year in part by PRSN But what most spectators won‚Äôt know is that one man has produced nearly every other rodeo in the Golden State at one time or another. Since Cotton Rosser bought the Flying U Rodeo Company 60 years ago, he has become a legend in the rodeo world. Everyone knows his name. ""The loveliest people are in rodeos,"" says Rosser. ""They do it because they love it, and it‚Äôs a Western way of life. They love the animals and the horses and the outdoors, and the atmosphere of rodeo is just barbecues and fun."" At 91 years old, Rosser has been honored by nearly every cowboy, rodeo or rancher hall of fame there is. He has a place in the Hall of Great Westerners, alongside John Wayne, Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower. But he was actually born a city kid in Long Beach in 1928. He grew up reading books about cowboys and watching Gene Autry, Will Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy. ‚ÄúI wanted to be a cowboy my whole life,‚Äù says Rosser. He was barely a teenager when he got a job on Santa Catalina Island, on a ranch owned by William Wrigley of chewing gum fame. At the time there were no cowboys for hire -- they were off fighting in World War II. So they gave young Cotton Rosser a chance, since he only had school half-days. ‚ÄúI used to clean stalls, clean the manure, and they let me ride a donkey named Jack,‚Äù says Rosser. And the donkey was just the beginning. Soon, he graduated to riding bulls and saddle broncs, and by the time he was a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, he turned pro. Rosser competed in rodeos all over the country. ‚Äú[The] Cow Palace, Las Vegas, Reno, Calgary Stampede,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAll the rodeos -- Cheyenne, [and] Pendleton.‚Äù In 1951, he even won the Grand National Rodeo‚Äôs all-around cowboy title. Then, in 1955, he broke both his legs in an accident while digging post holes on his Marysville ranch north of Sacramento. That ended his rodeo career. ‚Äú[It was the] best thing that ever happened to me,‚Äù Rosser says. He bought the Flying U Rodeo Company and started his career putting on shows and raising rodeo animals. Today, the Flying U is the oldest continually operating stock contracting company in the United States. Since he joined the rodeo world in the 1940s, Rosser has seen the sport change, and at times it seemed like fans were slipping away. To bring more people to the arena, the Flying U Rodeo Company got creative. It added high production value, loud rock 'n' roll, audience engagement and freestyle motocross -- dirt bike riders performing flips off tall ramps. And in recent years, Cotton says these new attractions have boosted attendance. That includes the Grand National Rodeo at the Cow Palace.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very action-packed,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always something new ! ProRodeo Hall of Fame stock contractor Cotton Rosser has been named the 2019 Legend of ProRodeo. Rosser was honored at the 12th annual Wrangler Gold Buckle Gala on Dec. 2 at the South Point Grand Ballroom in Las Vegas. ‚ÄúThis is a wonderful, great honor to receive,‚Äù said Rosser, 91. Rosser was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1995. Rosser and his son, Reno, operate the Flying U Rodeo and Rosser Rodeo stock contracting companies based in Marysville, Calif. They produce about 50 rodeos a year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the PR man now,‚Äù Cotton said with a chuckle. ‚ÄúI never imagined my rodeo career would be like this. I‚Äôm the richest guy in the world with memories and friends. I‚Äôve loved every minute of the rodeo business and I would do it all over again. It has been a great experience.‚Äù Rosser is the 14th man to be honored with the ProRodeo Legend award, following Jake Barnes, Jim Shoulders, Clem McSpadden, Harry Vold, Larry Mahan, Shawn Davis, Dean Oliver, Donnie Gay, Benny Binion, Mel Potter, Neal Gay, Michael Gaughan, and Keith Martin. Rosser is a pioneer in the rodeo industry who was ahead of his time in developing the entertainment side of rodeo. Rosser received the PRCA Donita Barnes Contract Personnel Lifetime Achievement award in 2015. ‚ÄúA lot of rodeos we have, we have had for 60 years, like the Cow Palace, Red Bluff (in California) and Reno (Nev.),‚Äù said Rosser, who served on the PRCA Board of Directors for many years. ‚ÄúThey even put a statue up in Reno of me (in 2014). It just doesn‚Äôt get much better. I have raised a good family and I really tried to help rodeo. Some people say if you‚Äôve seen one rodeo, you have seen them all, and I have always said I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs quite true. Rodeo is the greatest sport in the world, and I‚Äôm glad to have been a part of it for the last 70 years.‚Äù Rosser still rides a horse into the arena, and he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. ‚ÄúRodeo is the only thing I know,‚Äù Rosser said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt get better than that when you ride into the arena and they play the national anthem and there is a full house,‚Äù he said. For more than 60 years, Rosser has been known for his spectacular, flamboyant opening ceremonies at rodeos on the West Coast and for many years at the National Finals Rodeo. Rosser is considered the ‚ÄúP.T. Barnum‚Äù of professional rodeo. He has searched out ideas from sources as remote from the sport as ice shows and circuses, looking for that special something he can add to his productions. The other side of Rosser is his history as a top cowboy, who started competing in all of rodeo‚Äôs standard events as a teenager and later as a member of his college rodeo team at Cal Poly University-San Luis Obispo. As a professional, he won buckles, saddles and trophies. Among his many titles, one of Rosser‚Äôs highlights was winning the all-around title at the 1951 Grand National Rodeo in San Francisco. Rosser purchased the Flying U Rodeo Ranch in 1956, which is now the oldest continuing rodeo livestock company in the United States. In 1985, Rosser was named PRCA Stock Contractor of the Year.",71,67,0,4,0,0,0,0,2953285161349322,LummisforWyoming,/story.php?story_fbid=2953285161349322&id=369214063089791
