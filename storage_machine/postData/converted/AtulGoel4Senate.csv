Atul Goel for Senate,,2020-02-29 10:38:49,"Why vote for Atul Goel for US Senate? A summary: 1.  I am the ONLY candidate with a platform of UNITY and NOT ATTACKING the opposition.  I will end gridlock and get things done for our state and country. 2.  If you feel that big money (special interests, PACs, lobbyists, donations people outside NC) is bad in politics, then I am the ONLY candidate that has refused ALL big money.  I will be FREE to represent YOU. 3. I am the ONLY candidate that is QUALIFIED on healthcare: I have personal experience in all aspects of the complex health care industry. I won't have to rely on special interests & lobbyists after the election. 4.  I am the ONLY candidate with FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE of the immigration system.  We can control our borders, have legal immigration, support immigrant families, AND be HUMANE in our immigration policies. 5. I am the ONLY Democrat that will be effective passing policies to reduce gun violence. In my travels across ALL 100 NC counties, I talked with many Republicans.  I know that I can work with Republicans to finally end gridlock and find common ground. 6.  I am the ONLY Democrat that can REALLY deliver for Veterans.  I understand the VA system.  I was on staff at a VA hospital.  I made decisions on VA disability.  I will make certain that Veterans finally get the healthcare they have earned. In this election, Democrats have a choice. We can show the country how a candidate can win on PRINCIPLE - a candidate that is NOT a career politician, and who is NOT taking money. I am asking you to vote for me. And since I refused to take money, I have no budget for advertising.  If am the type of person that you wish would be represent you in the US Senate, then I am asking each of you to invest some time, and call everyone you know and ask them to look at my candidacy.

Atul Goel for Senate,,2020-02-18 10:18:40,"My response to the 1st question asked at the forum where all Dem US Senate candidates were present.  It was on healthcare.  I know that many people want ""Medicare for All"". I have expert, personal, knowledge of the healthcare industry.  Based on my experience, Medicare for All is not necessary, it would be highly disruptive, it's costs are unknown, many people don't want it, and it is not politically viable.  My goal is affordable healthcare access for all and I know how to get this finally accomplished.
