Justin O'Donnell for U.S. Senate,,2020-04-30 15:48:02,"The first generation of pokemon games is a funny little corolary to the current state of US Politics and Political Parties... (Colors are on point) Red and Blue versions were nearly identical in every way, with very few minor differences in the available pokemon. However, gameplay was identical, so were the glitches. And everyone had 1 favorite version they stood by (mine was blue version) but the reality was we all cheated the same and exploited the same glitches to win. Yellow version came out later, and provided the same conceptual style, but added major changes to the story and plotline, as well as significant changes to game play. But most importantly, in Yellow Version you had to win without exploiting the same glitches that made Blue and Red so easy. The developers patched it to make Yellow Version have a much harder path to the same win.  Blue Version and Red Version could still link with and compete against Yellow version players, but they still had access to infinite rare candies and other Items to make for an uneven playing field.   Yellow Version was easilly the best of Gen 1, because while it was certainly harder, it was a much more rewarding experience to win with it, knowing you had an uphill battle that the other kids at summer camp were cheating to beat.

Justin O'Donnell for U.S. Senate,,2020-04-21 02:08:47,"4/20 is a fun day of celebration for most of the country. But this year it fell on the culmimation of Patriots Day Weekend. Patriots Day is a holiday not celebrated by most of the country, but has a place of great prestige in Massachusetts, remembering the Battle of Concord and Lexington, and the begining of the American Revolution.  In a normal year, Patriots Day Weekend is capped off with Marathon Monday, the traditional running of the Boston Marathon, an iconic race through the Heart of Boston, bringing Thousands of runners, and Hundreds of thousands of spectators lining the course from Hopkinton to Boston to cheer them on.  However, this is not a typical year. The Boston Marathon was cancelled this year, which is a striking blow to both the small businesses on the route that depend on the days traffic, as well as the heart and soul of the greater Boston Area as a whole.  This isn't the first time in my life that the Marathon has been atypical. 7 years ago, on Patriots Day, I was serving in the Massachusetts National Guard and had volunteered to work security for the 2013 Boston Marathon. That was not a typical marathon, and the following days shook the very foundations of the Liberty and Freedom we were celebrating. It began a cascade of events that drastically changed my life, and my outlook on Liberty and freedom.  That series of events led to my inevitably getting involved with the Libertarian Party, running for office, and working tirelessly to protect the freedoms we hold so dear.

I was unhappy with the actions of some members of the Committee, and what I saw as a bad direction for the Libertarian Party. After the past 2 terms on the LNC, I could not be happier with the group of people I've gotten to work with, and am extremely proud of the progress we have made in growing the Libertarian Party.  The past term especially, we've seen traditional caucus lines dissolve, and ideological differences put aside as the members committee doubled efforts time and again to do what needed to be done to increase fundraising, grow membership, and ensure a positive future for Libertarians across the Country. As a member of the committee, Joe Bishop-Henchman has been a crucial key player in this positive growth. While I have chosen not to seek a 3rd term as the Region 8 Representative, I'm confident that under the leadership of Joe, the Libertarian Party can continue its historic growth.  Joe comes to the table with experience in running and growing a non profit advocacy group on a national scale, and has the skills and temperament to be a fantastic leader moving forward.

Justin O'Donnell for U.S. Senate,,2020-02-07 13:31:53,"Today, Hundreds of volunteers and supporters of Tulsi Gabbard will be assembling in New Hampshire to protest the exclusion of insurgent grassroots candidates from the Presidential Debate.  Libertarians know what it's like to be excluded from the conversation by the establishment powers. It happens all too often to us.  In 2018 I was excluded from the Congressional Debates in New Hampshire, with the excuse given that I did not reach their fundraising floor of $20,000 in support. I was attempting to self fund a small scale insurgent campaign on a low budget.  In 2020, we won't have that option. Seeing that the Establishment powers that be are willing to silence dissent even within their own two party ranks, we must be prepared to fight with everything we can muster to bring new voices to the debate stage this fall.  If 1,000 Libertarians each contributed only $20 this month, then we would have a first quarter fundraising report they wouldn't be able to ignore. We would ensure our path to ballot access, and begin chipping away at their excuses to keep us off the Debate Stage come October.  I can't do this without the support of each and every one of you.

Justin O'Donnell for U.S. Senate,,2020-02-05 10:55:10,"I will not be participating in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary as a voter.  Since the State of New Hampshire does not recognize The Libertarian Party as a political party, my official political party registration is ""unenrolled"" which allows me to take advantage of the semi-open primaries in NH, and vote in the Presidential preference Primary of whichever party I choose.  I have been mulling the consideration of this for the past few weeks, and listening to arguments for what Libertarians should do from a number of people, all with the best intentions. Some Argue that we should pull Republican Ballots to vote for a candidate other than Trump, in order to send a message to the establishment that there is dissent within the right. Some have argued that we should pull Democrat Ballots, and vote for Tulsi Gabbard to show support for an anti-war voice in a field of foreign policy hawks.  Some have Argued that we should pull Democrat Ballots and vote for Biden, to shore up his win in the Dem Primary, and hasten the coming of a General Election between two universally disliked candidates once again, in order to best position the Libertarian Nominee.  In my reflection I've decided that all of these approaches are simply taking steps to waste my vote.  In 2016, Gary Johnson answered the claims of voting for him being a waste by saying ""The only wasted vote, is a vote cast for someone you don't believe in.""  Well, here in 2020, there is not a single candidate in the Primary of either Major party who I believe represents me, or my values. So on principle, I will not waste my vote by casting it. I will not participate in an effort to influence the nomination process of an organization for which I am not a member or a supporter. I will go to work, I will go about my day, and then In May, I will cast my vote as a delegate to The Libertarian National Convention, for a Candidate who I believe in. In the meantime, I will continue to build my team for our upcoming campaign for US Senate, and take the steps necessary to provide an alternative for New Hampshire Voters come November.

The War on Drugs continues to terrorize communities of color, keeping people in a vicious cycle of incarceration and poverty.  Ideologically-motivated violence, like the mass shooting in El Paso, is seemingly on the rise and, as a result, many people on both sides of the aisle are calling for laws that would continue to weaken our right to self defense.  Libertarianism is more than an economic philosophy, more than a tax cut or a balanced budget. It’s a philosophy that understands that our right to personal and economic liberty is innate to our humanity, not something granted by popular vote.  When social issues pose the greatest threat to individual liberty, libertarians need to be at the forefront of political change. We need to speak up. We need to hold the establishment accountable as best we can.  If that seems too much to ask, maybe we should go home and quit the Liberty Movement.

Justin O'Donnell for U.S. Senate,,2019-06-10 12:49:26,"In 1973, a bi-partisan congressional commission recommended to the White House broad reforms, including decriminalization of drugs, as scientific evidence had shown that Marijuana was not as dangerous as it was reported, and that decriminalization and harm reduction would do more to solve problems of drug use than law enforcement.  Rather than take that advice, the Nixon Administration doubled down and launched the War on Drugs in order to bully their political enemies and minorities.  Nixon's own aide has outright admitted this.  ""We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate hippies with Marijuana and Blacks with Heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

We will have to travel the entire state, and meet with voters and stakeholders from Nashua to Pittsburg, from Keene to Portsmouth, and from Concord to Dixville Notch - this will cost money.  We will launch a marketing campaign to make sure that every single New Hampshire Voter goes to the polls in 2020 fully aware that I'm running for United States Senate - this will cost money.  We will make a BOLD statement this year, and we will refuse to be silenced and sent off to the corner - this will take your help!

Justin O'Donnell for U.S. Senate,,2019-01-29 17:37:21,"Tomorrow at 1:30 PM the New Hampshire House Elections law Committee will be hearing HB 643.  On the surface, this bill just changes the date of the Primary from the Tuesday before the first Wednesday in September, to the Tuesday before the first Wednesday in June.  Not only does this shift the primary up 3 months, but it would also shift the filing period, and petition gathering period up 3 months as well. And since Petitions for Independent and minor party candidates are due to the Supervisors of the Checklist for validation by 5pm on the Wednesday 5 weeks prior to the state Primary (RSA 655:41), and since NH has no mechanism for substitution of candidates, It would in effect require organizations like The Libertarian Party and The Green Party and The Constitution Party, who are not recognized as major parties by the State of New Hampshire, to hold their nominating Conventions prior to the new filing period which would begin in early March, rather than early June as it does currently.  Currently, as the Libertarian Party holds their nominating Convention in May of Presidential Years, we are able to petition our candidate onto the ballot in New Hampshire following said convention for 3,000 signatures. However, should this bill pass, the only option for access to the ballot that would be available to third party candidates, would be through an organizational petition starting January 1st, and collecting 17,407 valid signatures prior to the end of March, and submitting a list of nominated candidates afterwards.  I will be testifying against this Bill in Committee Tomorrow Afternoon, but should it pass, it would drastically alter the landscape of Presidential Ballot Access in New Hampshire, and make it significantly harder, and more costly to achieve ballot access in this state for the Libertarian Candidate.",6,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,2213839802199309,justin4liberty,/story.php?story_fbid=2213839802199309&id=1745722325677728
