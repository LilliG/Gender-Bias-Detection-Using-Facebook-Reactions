Candidates who do not reach threshold will not be permitted on the ballot. WHAT HAPPENS AT CAUCUS? You will meet with neighbors to determine the candidates you will send forward. Your role is to convince others your candidate is the best (hopefully me!)! Then, you will take a vote. Whichever candidates meet threshold will be assigned representatives (delegates). CAN’T I JUST WAIT TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARY? No! Only candidates with enough support at caucus will be able to make the ballot in June. If you want to vote for me then, we need you now!

Trish Zornio,,2020-02-26 08:42:38,"Running for office as a woman comes with unique challenges. Many weeks ago I was warned I was possibly being followed/stalked at events. A few weeks ago it began to escalate and even my opponent’s team warned me of this person in writing. At a political rally this past weekend I was targeted by this same person who wouldn’t leave me alone. Now we have incoming abusive threats every few minutes to hours from the same person because I will not respond to him or his threats. After two days and what must be hundreds of messages and fake content across multiple media platforms, today we got a glimpse of who we are dealing with. I share this not because I need help, but because I think it’s important for the public to get a glimpse of what really happens when women run for federal office. I never thought running for US Senate would be easy — I knew I’d get a GOP tracker (true), that my opponents would unfairly smear me in efforts to win (true), and that I’d put myself in a personally vulnerable position financially, emotionally, and otherwise (also true). I’m still so honored and excited to be running, and I’m working so hard to make the ballot (!), but for all the amazing things that happen and people I meet, there truly are many downright ugly experiences on the campaign trail — especially for women. Thankfully, these kind of experiences only serve to make me more passionate than ever to fight for change and especially to fight for women’s rights and safety. No man will ever keep me down! 😉  Have a great morning everyone, and in the spirit of asking for what we need, feel free to leave a little extra positive feedback to counteract. We women (and men!) have to stick together and lift each other when the going gets tough.

I‘m so proud of everything you’ve accomplished and are working toward for Colorado! Almost 10 years of friendship... climbing, hiking, human pyramids, music, & so much more. You’re amazing, Tai, keep on leading the way! 🥰This is Taishya Adams. You may recognize her as a commissioner for our agency, notably the first African American woman serving the commission in Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s history. When she’s not collaborating with stakeholders from across the state to fight for Colorado’s precious resources and shared humanity, Taishya can be found hitting the trails and slopes, climbing crags, enjoying her garden or sharing the company of others who love and cherish this planet.  “Every day in every way I am committed to using my power, privilege and platform to shatter systemic oppression, heal rifts, and create as much beauty and joy in the world as possible,” writes Taishya. In addition to her job with the American Institutes for Research, Taishya serves as the Outdoor Afro Colorado Co-Lead, connecting black people and allies to outdoor experiences and leadership opportunities. Taishya finds inspiration from the past and present to continue her work. The foundation for her passion? Harriet Tubman, whose ability to “free enslaved people hinged on her understanding of and respect for the natural world.” Taishya also cites author Carolyn Finney as an inspiration for her work. And finally, Taishya looks to Rue Mapp, the founder of Outdoor Afro, for providing her with a platform to serve her community and be an agent for change in the outdoors and beyond. #BlackHistoryMonth #livelifeoutsideCO",20,15,0,5,0,0,0,0,1040774749655322,TrishZornio2020,/story.php?story_fbid=1040774749655322&id=381682325564571

Trish Zornio,,2020-02-18 13:21:15,"Science not only advances society through breakthroughs in understanding, it also contributes significantly to Colorado‘s economy. In fact, Colorado is home to 33 federal laboratories, as well as world-class institutions and innovative start-ups, which combined contribute billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs to our economy￼￼. Yet Trump, supported by our current Senator Cory Gardner, continues to propose further cuts to scientific endeavors which would impact Coloradans directly in our pocketbooks. As a scientist running for US Senate in Colorado, I understand the value — both economically and for long term progress — of investing in science now. This is why a backbone of my policy proposals include significant increases in research and technology funds that would benefit Coloradans statewide.￼￼ Further, Cory Gardner denies basic scientific facts (e.g. climate change) in addition to the need to fund science appropriately. Gardner is therefore grossly unqualified to sit on the US Senate science committee, yet he — along with other non-scientists— are all we currently have.  This election cycle vote for science.

Trish Zornio,,2020-02-11 09:47:47,"COLORADO VOTERS: We’re hearing a lot of confusion over whether or not we have caucus this year. The answer is YES!  SCHEDULE: FEBRUARY 14th — deadline to be registered Dem to participate in caucus MARCH 3rd — presidential primary ballot. Unaffiliateds choose one ballot to return MARCH 7th — US Senate caucus, you must be registered Dem to participate. This determines which candidates will make the June primary ballot. As a candidate for US Senate, this is how you can support me. **YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR ME IN JUNE IF I DO NOT PASS CAUCUS, so we need you to show up on 3/7!** WHAT IS CAUCUS? The caucus is where *democrats* gather together to determine who will be on the primary ballot in June. You’ll attend your local precinct (e.g. in a middle school, a library, or another community building) and make your voice heard. Your precinct is your neighborhood, more-or-less. Before you can caucus, you need three things. First, you need to be registered to vote at your current address as a Democrat by February 14th. You can check if you’re registered, and which party you’re affiliated with, at GoVoteColorado.com.  Next, you need your precinct number. You get your precinct number from GoVoteColorado.com as well! Once you’ve found your registration, go to the “County & District Information” tab, and your precinct number will be right at the top!  Finally, you need your caucus location. You can find this by going to ColoradoDems.org; caucus locations are listed by precinct, so make sure you find your number first!  **Caucusing for Trish and need help? Email caucus@zornio2020.com** Once all that is done, the fun can start!  Caucus will be Saturday, March 7th. You should arrive between 1pm-1:30pm…doors close at 2pm sharp, so don’t be late! Once you’re inside, you will find the caucus organizer and check in with your name and precinct number, then you’ll be directed to the area that’s designated for your precinct. At 2pm, doors close, and the caucus really starts! There will then be an area designated for supporters of Trish Zornio—that’s where you should stand! Fight as part of Team Trish to convince undecided voters to stand with Zornio! After this first round, candidates with less than 15% of the supporters at your caucus will be eliminated, and these caucusers will have to pick a new camp; try and get them in the Zornio camp! The more caucus-goers in the Zornio camp, the more delegates we can send to the State Assembly on April 18th. Only the candidates with over 30% of delegates at State Assembly get put on the ballot, so our goal is to get as many delegates as possible!

But check out these numbers: 😱 Gardner further declined in the polls to a jaw-dropping low of only 33% approval, and all Dems poll a minimum of 10pts ahead of Gardner!  💙 In 2016, Trump lost Colorado by 5pts (thank you fellow Coloradans!)  💙 In 2018, Colorado went full blue for the first time!

This is it.  During his time as Governor, Hickenlooper not only did nothing to improve Colorado’s air quality, but he actively fought standards being enacted citing economics. But the reality was that he wanted to ensure his donors in oil and gas were not impacted, and he did so at the expense of public health for millions of Coloradans.

Trish Zornio,,2020-01-24 13:27:34,"I’ve worked in hospitals/clinics for years, and the biggest shift I’ve seen amongst administrators is a drive toward increasing profits over patient wellbeing. Often the CEOs are no longer physicians who have risen up the ranks, but instead big business CEOs who come in with little to no healthcare experience specifically to maximize profit. Once, at a Denver hospital I was helping run a study in, I was even mandated to take a “customer service training” where they taught doctors how to create “repeat customers”. After the third such announcement I stood up and replied, “If you think creating repeat customers at an emergency hospital (not primary care clinic) is the goal, you have no business working in healthcare.” Needless to say the administration in the room was not thrilled with my interjection, but the entire care team erupted in applause. Fighting for true universal, comprehensive and preventative healthcare is a passion I have long rallied for. A vote for me as your next U.S. Senator will elect this passion and expertise at the federal level every step of the way.

As air quality surpassed federal EPA standards, instead of protecting Coloradans he sought exemptions so oil and gas companies wouldn’t get regulated on emissions. This election cycle the polls show a generic Democrat beats Cory Gardner by 10pts. Do not buy into the DC narrative that only Hickenlooper is viable to win — he’s not. This year, we can elect a real scientist who will act swiftly on climate and public health, put Coloradans over corporations, and elect the first woman US Senator ever from Colorado.

Trish Zornio,,2020-01-12 10:20:18,"As an educator myself I‘ve long supported a basic federal common core curriculum (e.g. evolution not creationism) to ensure American children get consistent and quality education no matter where they grow up. This comparison of textbooks between two states shows why it’s vital. Additionally, without such basic common core curriculum at a federal level — one that also includes which subjects get taught at which grades — we risk increasing the number of children impacted as our highly mobile society expands. In our travels we often hear from teachers and parents who have had to deal with children repeating or missing courses because the school they went to in another state had a different curriculum schedule.  To be clear, I never want to take away teacher autonomy, and I would never proposed a teach-to-the-test style curriculum. This is strictly about achieving federal standards for basic curricula content to ensure consistent and quality public education across our vast nation.

But there is one community we often forget, one that happens to include me. In America so much is built on religion, specifically Christianity. Our pledge of allegiance recites “one nation under God” and even our official American motto is “In God we trust”. But some of us are not religious, myself included, and for years we have hid in the shadows of fear for being seen as unpatriotic, un-American, or simply un-moral. In my case, there’s the added fear of being unelectable — we’ve not only never had an openly atheist U.S. Senator in Colorado (or hardly anywhere), polls have shown non-religious people are often less electable than just about any other identity. (The Left is beginning to shift on this which is a good sign) Growing up Catholic I have long appreciated the community aspect of church and I respect your right to any religion or faith of your choice. But with Trump leading the GOP charge to mandate religion in public schools, it’s time we end the silence on my right to choose no religion as a valid, American, moral choice.

He laid unconscious in a pool of his own blood, face-down on a cold cement floor for hours before he was later found dead. Three wellness checks were supposedly carried out during this time according to CBP logs, yet none reported the situation. If this is too harsh for you, imagine what it was like for the child who died and the children who found him. This child is one of 6 who have been reported to have died while in American custody.

Human suffering aside, global instability ultimately leads to crisis on the home front. As regions like this fall on hard times, millions of people are impacted and economic stability is devastated. Such regional instability leads to conflict over the shortage of basic needs, like water and food, and can ultimately lead to necessary migration. Refugees must find new places — and sometimes new countries — to live. Climate refugees will be one of many large economic impacts of climate change. For years, we’ve wasted time debating if climate change was happening rather than acting. Meanwhile, the U.S. military has long noted environmental security is one of the top threats to national security since at least 2007. It’s not just that temperatures rise, cities flood, or that severe droughts occur, it’s that these events contribute to destabilized or unlivable regions and ultimately people are forced to go elsewhere.  The 2020 elections will be the difference between addressing the effects of climate change or not.

Trish Zornio,,2019-11-24 11:00:52,"When we discuss vaccinations we often fail to discuss a critical part...  Russian influence. In recent years, evidence is mounting that Russia has spent well over a decade sowing more than strictly political disinformation. In fact, many experts are now finding evidence of disinformation campaigns for the anti-vaccination movement and more. Why? It’s about sowing discourse to undermine the democratic process. Over time, these topics become political, and can erode trust in a democracy from within. Make no mistake, this is modern warfare, and it’s dangerous. Over many years of growth, the anti-vaccination movement has now helped to foster divisiveness in largely the Democratic Party leading some to leave the party altogether. This fracturing of political blocks is what allows for the rise of authoritarian outsiders like Trump who systematically undermine democratic principles. These tactics also have far reaching impacts — in this case, people die. What does this mean for Colorado? In short, we are due for a massive outbreak due to having the lowest vaccination rates in the country. And this particular disinformation campaign seems to affect politically blue regions more than red ones, so parts of the Front Range are at highest risk. Scientifically speaking, approximately 95% of the population must vaccinate for it to be effective. Given some people for health reasons are unable to vaccinate, this requires nearly all the remaining population to stay up to date on vaccines for them to be effective. In Colorado, our state average in 2019 vaccination rate is only 89%, well below the needed 95% threshold. But this problem is only just beginning — some incoming kindergarten classes in Colorado, such as some schools in Aurora, Longmont, and Firestone, have reported rates as low as a staggering 24%. The long term ramifications are deeply concerning. In a highly mobile world, coupled with changes in viral transmission due to our changing climate, Colorado kids are at significant health risks for the first time in decades. I know that for some this is a difficult post, even for people who may otherwise agree with me. But the evidence is so clear — the Russians have worked to sow discourse on anti-vaccination campaigns just as much as they have on other political topics. If you struggle with whether or not vaccinations are effective, consider this... if you acknowledge Russian influence in our democracy, if you acknowledge Trump as an illegitimate president accordingly, and if you acknowledge the science of topics like climate change, I urge you to reconsider the role of disinformation campaigns in the topic of vaccinations — just like anti-climate change beliefs can kill us, anti-vaccination beliefs can, too. https://bbc.in/35oSZyR",136,68,1,8,20,34,5,19,960272367705561,TrishZornio2020,/story.php?story_fbid=960272367705561&id=381682325564571

I was already standing. (FYI, women are shorter than men and podiums / chairs / tables / other presentation equipment should be provided by hosts for women’s specifications, too.) 3) The men (plural) who like to tell me after every event that I’d be better if only my voice were a lower pitch. 4) The incessant comments on my appearance. Everything from “Hey babe/sweetheart/girlie/etc.” to dress and make up suggestions and more. 5) A shocking number of Democratic men who have told me women are biologically inferior to men, and since I’m a scientist I should recognize that.

Our infrastructure is outdated, our education system is lagging, housing is too costly, and our air quality has exceeded federal standards for over a decade, just to name a few.  It’s time we update our standards for what it means to be economically “booming”.

I look forward to hearing about your updated stance on fracking in communities following this report. This study shows effects up to 2,000’. Many other studies have effects correlated up to 10,000’, including low birth weight in newborns which is consistent with chronic health issues.  Given CDPHE is now aware, are you willing to keep risking the health of Coloradans? I look forward to hearing at the forum in Montrose this weekend. And, perhaps, an apology for accusing the scientist who actually works in public health of cherry picking data about public health? https://www.westword.com/news/long-awaited-colorado-health-study-finds-significant-risks-from-fracking-11516032",206,147,4,32,14,2,7,23,927020364364095,TrishZornio2020,/story.php?story_fbid=927020364364095&id=381682325564571

Trish Zornio,,2019-10-05 10:38:03,"Fifteen hours ago, Trump made a Presidential Proclamation that immigrants who cannot prove they will have health insurance that is not subsidized will not be permitted into the U.S. (See release for full details) First of all, I’d like to remind Trump that not only does he have tax payer funded healthcare, as does his wife Melania, an immigrant. Second, ~30M citizens have NO healthcare at all, including me, so it’s hardly a barrier to citizenship. Third, and most importantly, my partner is an immigrant. While he has healthcare through his work for now (ironic given I don’t as a working citizen), this is deeply concerning for us. My work wouldn’t cover us in the event of his contract ending (next year) or should the job go away for any reason, or even just in between jobs. Even if we married, spouses aren’t protected by this new proclamation. He would be forced to return to Israel, and our relationship put in jeopardy. This so-called President has impacted my personal life in so many ways it is getting hard to count, but here are a few: 1) When he first took office, he threatened to cut the NIH funds 30% — this is my job. 2) Then he took away the first time home buyer incentives as I was putting in offers on homes — I could no longer afford it.  3) Then he started systematically degrading science, which is my livelihood, because it wasn’t enough to threaten just one job. 4) Then he said there were “very fine people on both sides”... nope, Nazis. (my partner is Jewish) 5) Then he sought to systematically undermine the ACA, when I can’t even afford healthcare in the first place. 6) Then he rolled back emission standards, increasing greenhouse gas emissions 3.4% in 2018, undermining my best shot for a healthy climate as I get older and have a family. He’ll be dead, but I’ll be here cleaning up the mess. 7) Then he skyrocketed us into national debt to give wealthy people more money. My generation will have to pay that off. 8 ) Then he appointed Brett Kavanagh to ultimately dismantle my rights as a woman in the highest courts, along with multiple degradation of women’s rights along the way. 9) Now he’s actively undermining my relationship.

We are a decade behind this modern form of warfare and we do not have sufficient tools to fight it. For over a decade, Russian interference has now been demonstrated in arenas ranging from election security to disinformation tactics on topics as wide as fake candidate websites to anti-vaccination campaigns, all in the name of creating discourse and division. Make no mistake, this is modern war. We used to fight our wars on land, sea, and in the air. These days are fading. Wars are now being fought with data, information tactics, infrastructure destruction (e.g. grid-hacking), and biological warfare (which includes manipulative psychological tactics). This is the 21st Century and we need 21st Century security. I know that running on a platform of science and technology might seem, at best, mundane or even boring to some. I suppose in some ways this makes me the kale of candidates — the healthiest option, but not what you crave. But I beg you to appreciate the grave nature of what is at stake without our expertise from the scientific and technological communities... - Cyber warfare (hacking for espionage, data breeches, etc.) - Grid security (internet, transportation, cell service, etc.) - Election security - Medical data security - Environmental security & more For these reasons and more, I hope you will join our campaign for the U.S. Senate in Colorado.

Trish Zornio,,2019-10-01 18:39:57,"In keeping up with the science of our changing climate, I must impress upon you the ever-growing urgency of the economic and national security impacts. With every policy decision that is made in ignorance of the science, the outcomes become more and more serious. In the scientific community we have known for decades the ramifications of man-emitted greenhouse gases and little has been done to change the trajectory despite this evidence. Scientists have warned executives of fossil fuel companies as far back as the 1950-1960s of the dangers. Again, nothing was done by them or elected officials. Climate change is not something that will happen, it’s something that has been happening for decades, and the visible, tangible effects to daily life are only just starting to reveal themselves.  Moreover, the pending economic impacts will be catastrophic to any entity which has not prepared accordingly, and at best can likely only now be lessened, not eliminated. Climate migration is already underway and will only increase immigration and refugees dramatically in the coming years. Costly storms which batter our communities will continue to become more intense more often. Heat records will continue to be broken making some regions uninhabitable for humans. The rise of sea levels will continue to flood coastal cities.  If it feels grim, that’s because it is, yet all hope is not yet lost. For all these reasons and more, addressing climate change is the top priority for our campaign, and I am excited to inform you that this Sunday we will be launching our strategic and evidence-driven plan to combat the climate crisis.

In the spirit of sharing, I’d like to share with you some of my day-to-day actions on climate that have long been part of my routine. For context, I grew up being taught that climate change wasn’t happening. But in college I learned about the science and realized the gravity of the situation. I then started reading about how we could individually take steps to reduce them, while we waited for the government to act more largely. At the age of 20, nearly 15 years ago, I made a series of daily changes that still last for me today: 1) I changed my diet to reflect lower emissions. Starting at age 20 I chose a local and seasonal vegan diet (I learned a whole new set of foods and cooking styles) and am still mostly vegan today. 2) I walk/bike/ski/bus/carpool in efforts to reduce transportation emissions. Even today I will take the RTD bus to work. I then walk ~1.2 miles each way to campus. Sometimes I take my bike instead. Rain or shine and bonus for activity! 3) In an effort to reduce emissions and waste, I’m more of a minimalist. I don’t buy a lot of new stuff, and when I do I make sure it’s high quality that will last. I skip plastics/polyester etc. unless they are second hand or really needed. I both shop at thrift stores and donate back to them. I make the sacrifices of not always having the newest thing (which explains why I still have a year 2000 car) and go more for functionality, durability, and low impact instead. It’s always a balance, but I make good-faith efforts to RRR!  4) I cut food waste by only buying what I can actually eat, composting when possible, and recycling (the right way!). 5) I try to reduce overall energy consumption. As a renter, I can’t install solar panels, but I can do my best to only run AC or heat when it’s needed. I use a programmable thermostat and monitor it daily. There are many other ways I have worked to change my actions, but these are a few. I know these may not work for everyone, but they work for me. My next step is fighting for large systemic changes at the federal level to reduce emissions!

Trish Zornio,,2019-09-18 10:33:26,"These findings should concern every Coloradan. Since 2004, air pollution in the Front Range has exceeded federal standards. This is directly affecting public health and the ability of families to thrive. We absolutely must move away from burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible in the best interest of human health and safety. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/air-pollution-particles-found-on-foetal-side-of-placentas-study",126,38,0,0,27,46,15,4,903612756704856,TrishZornio2020,/story.php?story_fbid=903612756704856&id=381682325564571
Trish Zornio,,2019-09-17 20:35:10,"It has recently come to my attention that during our most recent travels news broke about a situation on the Front Range involving four CSU students wearing blackface. The photo was circulated on social media, and unfortunately, little to nothing was done in response to these actions by the university administration. As a lecturer at another local university, I find this lack of response extremely disheartening and problematic. This signals to students of color that their value and safety is less important. Moreover, it sends the message that further behavior like this will go unpunished, cracking opening the door for future discrimination. Adding to concerns, it appears initial news reports focused almost exclusively on the young woman in blackface seen in the photo, and the reasons why she did it. At the same time, no reports appear to have come out regarding how students of color felt after the event. Again, this disparity of coverage only works to worsen the incidence and further exacerbate racial disparity. In the most recent news release, below, the university administration is reportedly now considering initiatives, and reporters have begun to interview students of color on how they felt on campus. These appear to have come out of significant activist efforts (thank you to the students writing in chalk, etc.). Sadly, this isn’t enough. With the systemic nature of racial bias, many students continue to express feelings of discomfort, a lack of respect, and a fear for safety regardless of this incident. One student said: “When you talk to other students of color, a lot of them have these same experiences,” she explained. “A lot of them will tell you, ‘I sit in the back of the class. I don’t feel comfortable raising my hand or speaking.’” As a teacher myself, it pains me deeply to know any student feels this way. As teachers we rely on the support of the administration to provide all students with a safe campus. While not all instances can be prevented, the method of handling the issues that arise is critical. In this instance, I believe the administration has failed. Moving forward, I hope to see many partnerships on campus initiatives to provide a safe campus environment come from the administration, including (but not limited to) further educating both staff and students on both implicit and explicit racial bias. Moreover, I call on all Colorado universities to use this incidence as an example to begin addressing the issue of racial bias at every campus statewide. A safe school environment should be a top priority for all. https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/09/16/joyce-mcconnell-csu-blackface-controversy/",90,46,0,0,6,11,27,12,903217783411020,TrishZornio2020,/story.php?story_fbid=903217783411020&id=381682325564571

This year, those of us in Boulder County have experienced significant issues in this department, including unexpected closures of major roadways, 36 (to Denver) and Boulder Canyon (to Nederland). We’ve also had to deal with fighting big oil for local control of lands and resources, an ongoing lack of reliable cell/internet service, elevated plutonium readings which affect development and public safety due to building proximity, polluted air due to irresponsible development, and of course, for years we are still waiting for our RTD train to the airport!

Trish Zornio,,2019-08-20 09:01:41,"Yesterday we broke another long standing record in Denver at 98F. Our local schools, built in the 1920’s, were never designed to need AC. It’s only in recent years that there has been such a need. As a result, classrooms in ~60 schools reached over 90F indoors during school hours. The cost to retrofit is estimated at a whopping ~$3-4M per school. Teachers have spent more of their hard earned money to purchase window ACs, but students and staff still suffered from overheating. It’s a paltry learning environment at best. Addressing our changing climate is about more than a moral responsibility, it’s a fiscal necessity. It will only cost us more and more the longer we wait. On October 6th in Colorado Springs I will be speaking at the first Senate forum for addressing climate change.
