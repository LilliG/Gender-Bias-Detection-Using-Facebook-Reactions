Dr. Tom Tarter,,2020-01-12 23:28:45,"Dear Friends and Supporters: Time for the Sunday Post. This was a busy week of fundraising, campaigning, and planning with my political team.  Tuesday met with West Suburban Patriots in Carol Stream. Small group, but some travelled from Chicago to be there. Conversations delved into the issues deeper than most group meetings. Really enjoyed it.  Wednesday morning I taped a 2 min talk at Chicago PBS station WTTW. They have a video voters guide that gets a lot of hits, and is supported by the venerable League of Women Voters. This was my first time reading from a teleprompter. I will let you know when and how to see it. That evening spoke to Milton Township Republican Organization. My talk was received well and the fellowship among conservative Republicans was great. My sense is that I have strong support in DuPage County. I have solid grassroots support there.  Thursday night I spoke to the Illinois State Rifle Association. I am an NRA member, and years ago worked my way up to NRA Sharpshooter at 50 feet with a 22 rifle. I went through the NRA federal legislative agenda. I appreciate the advice and support of the ISRA! After I am elected, I will have an A rating from the NRA, compared to Dick Durban‚Äôs F rating.  Friday was spent fundraising and working with my political team. Had to return to Springfield on Saturday because my car told me that the brake pads need to be replaced. My son Sergei and I will be participating in the Right to Life program in the State Capitol rotunda on January 26th.  Today is the Feast of the Baptism of Jesus. Can you imagine being John the Baptist with the Son of God not taking no for an answer and making you immerse him in the water? Most of us don‚Äôt remember our baptisms. I remember mine because I was baptized with my infant twin boys 21 years ago. With baptism comes the responsibility to lead a Christian life of love of God and neighbor.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2020-01-07 00:29:15,"Hello Dear Friends. I introduced my campaign to the Northern Illinois Republican Women at the Cherry Valley Cafe on Saturday morning. The meeting was well attended and the questions were thoughtful and sometimes challenging. I loved meeting with this group of patriots. Thank you Catarina Mater and Kathie Hansen for the invitation and for your leadership. A NY Times editorial the day before announced that Republican women are in crisis. I have experienced the opposite in my meetings throughout the state. Republican women in Illinois are leading our party. It is the women‚Äôs groups who reach out to the candidates, and the women County Party Chairs are among the most hard-working and respected. My main grassroots supporters, mostly women, who contacted me are my most ardent supporters. The Times, like the liberal Chicago echo chamber is very out of touch with America. Glad I got that out! My wife, Julie, has worked tirelessly for the GOP in Sangamon County over the last 18 years. Our youngest son, Sergei, who has walked his mother‚Äôs precinct ever since he could walk, wanted his own precinct after he graduated from HS, and was sworn-in as a Republican P.C. last July. Republican women are in charge, not in crisis!!      After the NIRW meeting, we participated in the pro-Trump Rally in Algonquin. The crowd was impressive, and there was even some fair media coverage which was even more impressive. Honking versus flipping the bird was about 100:1. Met and spoke with many wonderful Illinoisans who, like me, are standing our ground. Sergei handed out my campaign pamphlets to most of the Trump supporters. I‚Äôm going to keep him.       After the rally, we met at the Colonial cafe which was organized by Susie Ejzak to support the James Marter and Dr. Tom Tarter campaigns. It was an incredible gathering. Jim and I gave stump speeches, but our friends and supporters actually asked some of the most difficult questions I‚Äôve had, like on controlling prescription drug costs for Medicare recipients. I loved it. Real and informed questions will make me a better candidate and Senator. Thank you Sussie, Jennifer, Linda, Connie, Rocky and all for everything you are doing for my campaign.      On Sunday, Sergei and I attended mass at St. Theresa in Palatine. Sergei and I participated in the Palatine March for Life on October 19, which was organized by the St. Theresa parish. After mass, the organizer of the March for Life, Laura Vandercar, greeted us and introduced us to her mother. I have attended many Right to Life events, but the Palatine event last October was memorable. Laura is a humble and powerful disciple of Christ, and it was nice to connect with her on Sunday.       Now I‚Äôm back to the fundraising and attending Republican and conservative group meetings. Also working on media opportunities. I am pumped and can‚Äôt wait for every opportunity to promote my winning campaign. Best wishes always. Go to DrTarter.com if you can make a contribution. Thank you! God Bless all of you.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-29 20:29:01,"Good evening Dear Friends. I trust you had a warm Christmas or Hanukkah. I hope my Muslim and Hindu neighbors also had a refreshing week with kids home from school. I hope my atheist friends will see the love in this season of hope for the world. Emanuel, or God with us, is love incarnate, and I wish the love of Christ for everyone. My family celebrated Christmas and last night we celebrated my son Sergei‚Äôs 21st birthday early. He and I will be in Chicago on his birthday.  For the uninitiated, candidates get a lot of questionnaires from the media and special interest groups. With the campaign schedule, fundraising, and doing homework on the issues, time is precious. Many questionnaires want to know the candidate‚Äôs view on immigration in 300 or 500 words. Illegal immigration is a no-brainer. It needs to end. But I try to explain my views on legal immigration and describe my neighborhood with naturalized citizens from around the world. Our country needs more legal immigration, not less for our future needs. Like my neighbors, immigrants need to be productive, speak English and assimilate. Our kids grew up together, and we celebrate Independence Day together. That‚Äôs America, and has been until just recently. You can read my immigration paper on the campaign web site when it is finished.  Yesterday my son Sergei and I participated in a pro-Trump rally in Decatur. There were a handful of counter-protesters on the other side of the street, and not a single American flag there. I am now completely out of campaign materials to pass out, but will get re-supplied by my campaign team in Chicago this week. Spent most  of my time in last 2 weeks with fundraising. Asking people for money without a tax break is not for the timid. It comes down to the time and numbers of like-minded people reached. It‚Äôs a lot of work, and I am working very hard every day.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-22 23:42:58,"Sunday night post to my dear friends.  My last patient was seen on Thursday at noon. She held me tightly and got tearful. The truth is that my nurse, Tiffany got her through her anxiety of her cancer care. I have realized over the years that I have the knowledge and  skill to care for patients, but that the nurses and staff are the ones who help them the most with the anxiety and doubt. I have always been blessed with a wonderful team.  Friday my son Sergei and I attended the Illinois Policy Institute reception in Collinsville. Conservative talk show host Annie Frey was the speaker, and she kept her remarks brief. It was a very nice and relaxed time, and I spoke with everyone about my campaign.  Saturday was in Schaumburg for Township Republican Organization endorsement candidate forum. One of the candidates showed up halfway through the 30 min meeting, and the Executive Committee bent over backwards to offer equal time. As a former surgeon and youth baseball coach, I have had the ethic that if you are on time you are late. The STRO did not make an endorsement, which will be made after a general meeting on January 25. I‚Äôm up for it!  Saturday afternoon, my son Andrei and I participated in the Frankfort pro-Trump rally at the corner of US 45 and 30. It was an awesome event organized by George Pearson and the Will county Republican Party. There was a huge crowd on all 4 corners of the intersection. I spoke with as many folks as I could. Cars honking support vs flipping the bird were 100 to 1. HA! It was cool. A fire truck rounded a corner with horn blaring to a huge cheer. I turned to a man holding a 2A flag and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me that trade unions don‚Äôt like Trump.‚Äù He told me about his trade union, and informed me that ‚Äúrank and file‚Äù members support the President despite pressure from the leaders. We The People are the rank and file, and we don‚Äôt like being pushed around by the radical left. We love life and liberty. God I loved being there! Thank you George Pearson and the Will County Republican Party for organizing this great gathering that inspired so many. Took today off for church and family time.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-19 00:26:43,"To my incredible partners and staff, thank you!. Tomorrow is my last day as a urological oncologist after 38 years of research and 29 years of clinical practice. I am an emotional person, like most of you. But I haven‚Äôt felt it until I got an email today from a man who had a rare cancer. There were no guidelines and very little literature to guide his treatment. He went through a lot, but 6 years later he‚Äôs cancer free. I thank God for the judgement, skill, and temperament for myself and the research and doctors before me who published their results on this rare cancer. I got emotional tonight, not because of my retirement, but because of the thank you email from my friend who could have died from a rare cancer,       So this is it. I‚Äôve stepped off the cliff from my comfortable life. I am now on a retirement income. My ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù life also included major cancer surgeries that lasted up to 8 hours, 12 - 14 hour days, and emergency call. Now there will be no more crawling out of bed at 3 AM for an emergency. I am retiring 3 years earlier from a job that I absolutely love and am good at for this campaign.      At this point, I have raised more funds, spent the least, and have more cash on hand than the other Republican candidates who have filed. I have done statewide polling with a company that polls for the RNC, and I‚Äôve hired my ground team. Every contributor to my campaign to replace Dick Durbin, needs to know that their dollars have value - the most bang for the political buck. My main competitors have had the opportunity to work full-time on their campaigns and I have been working full-time and campaigning.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-18 22:01:04,"Tonight's impeachment votes will put a stain on our country's democracy for years to come and set forward the precedent that regardless of what the voters decide at the ballot box, elected officials can impeach a president just because they don't like that individual. Like many people in Illinois and across our country, I do not support impeachment or the politically-charged attempt to move on with impeachment on the grounds that the Democrats do not like the president and that they are doing this because they fear he will win in 2020. After the Mueller investigation cost more than $32 million and wasted 2 years of people‚Äôs time, their initial hopes of impeaching President Trump completely backfired. After all the time and money spent, they were not able to find impeachable offenses by the president and that is where we are at again as Congress unconstitutionally impeached President Trump tonight. Instead of wasting tax dollars and the time of the American people, they should start focusing on passing legislation that matters to people‚Äôs daily lives. They should be focusing on growing our booming economy, working on immigration reform, and doing what they can to create more jobs. While Dick Durbin supports the impeachment and represents only the narrow view of liberal Chicago, I‚Äôll stand up for the rest of Illinois and be a strong critic of this political charade.

Things change, but for a while we were the only place, other than the Mayo Clinic, for patients with relapsed prostate cancer to get a PET scan that shows where cancer is located. DMH Radiology is world class! We have a robotic surgery program that is second to none! The surgical staff at DMH is wonderful, and they master the advanced surgical technologies. We have doubled our prostate cancer screening with outreach to the African American community. We have a Community Oncology Program accredited by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. I chaired our committee, and I am very proud of our staff and volunteers for our accreditation and for earning 5 of 6 commendations. My practice at Cancer Care Specialists of Illinois, serving as a researcher in the Heartland National Community Oncology Research Program, chairing the DMH Cancer Committee, and leading the robotic surgery program have been the highlights of my long career in medical research and clinical practice.       Thank you Tiffany, Nicole and sponsors, Joel Peterson and David Guller, for a wonderful evening. I am grateful for your friendship and generosity. Picture is Tiffany Hall,RN on right, and Nicole Soper, FNP on left. A great team!       Tonight, on my retirement from a job that I love, I am also especially grateful to Drs Wade, Esparaz, Elliott, and all of my partners at CCSI for a productive and truly meaningful partnership.       Best wishes to all of my friends and colleagues, and Merry Christmas! Tom Tarter",223,191,0,32,0,0,0,19,508200733373896,DrTarter,/story.php?story_fbid=508200733373896&id=387260852134552

My wife, the civil engineer (I married up), purchased phones for the family with reward points from our credit card company.      I have been spending the final days of the last quarter with fundraising. If you are reading this, be prepared for a phone call. Kidding, but I am making a lot of calls to friends who have the means to support my campaign. Folks who donate money are incredible because they are giving for the hope of our future, and there is no tax break. I have given a lot to politicians for a better future, and I am grateful beyond words to all who have contributed to my campaign. It was hard at first to ask for money, but I‚Äôm over it now because I believe so strongly about immigration reform and prosperity.      Impeachment dominates the news, but not in our lives.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-09 01:35:00,"Just changed phones today from Google pixel to iPhone. Love the new phone, but transferring my FB account not easy. Will try tomorrow. So no traditional Sunday campaign post tonight. But I  had a busy and incredibly productive week on campaign. Unlike Hubbard and Curran, I have been working full-time and getting great statewide support and raising a lot of money. I work harder and smarter with the time I have. Thursday night, I participated in the Bremen Township/Will County Republican candidate forum. I got a lot of support from the Republican leaders. Friday night, I had a warm Christmas party at my home with my family, donors, and Sangamon County Republican leaders. On Saturday, I participated as an invited speaker to the Southwest Suburban Republican Women's Christmas luncheon. I appreciate the support of these incredible Republican leaders and organizers. I will rely on them in the general election. Today was a day off and went to Church with family and friends, got new phone, worked on fundraising, and now you, my FB family. I never had FB until campaign, but love the direct talk.  I believe the campaign will come in with another winning fourth quarter of fundraising. If you'd like to contribute to the next Republican nominee for Senate from Illinois, now is the time. This quarter of fundraising will determine the future.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-03 00:35:01,"Went to Guns Save Life meeting tonight at Scheels, which is a 5 min drive from my home. I was invited by a Korean War veteran, Joel Gain, who I met at a Petersburg Harvest Fest Parade on September 21.  There were about 100 members present, including two men who underwent their cancer surgeries by me. I was allowed 5 minutes to introduce my campaign, which I did with prepared remarks, and I answered questions. It was amazing to me to be invited to this meeting on the very day that the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on a Second Amendment case, only the second time in 10 years. Dick Durbin was one of 5 Democrat Senators to submit an amicus brief in this case that threatened the Supreme Court with legislative action to reduce their authority, presumably with court packing. Tried and failed under FDR. Learned a lot about specific guns tonight, and there was a presentation by an extremely creative man who figured a way to configure the ammunition for handgun for deer hunting from 100 to 200 yards. The meeting could have been a graduate school seminar in small arms. I picked up a shotgun, which looked like an AK15. It was a 12g shotgun. It was heavy and very cool. Great evening among like-minded neighbors and new friends. Many more events scheduled for this week and next. God Bless you.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-12-02 00:58:09,"I trust my friends had a warm and memorable Thanksgiving. The campaign was temporarily suspended, and my family and I relaxed, watched movies, laughed a lot, and prayed. I had to remind myself that 3 day leftovers are a blessing, and only a first world problem. Tomorrow, day 4.      My son Sergei and I drove to Plainfield and Joliet on Friday to get more signatures for Tom McCallagh, Republican candidate for State senator in the 49th district. The district is a beautiful part of Will County. Tom is a small business owner with 27 employees. He's the real  deal, and has a better than even chance of flipping the district. The petitions were notarized today. Tonight I delivered the petitions to Tom here in Springfield at the Illinois Republican senatorial campaign office. He was with other state senatorial candidates who were finalizing their petitions. I met Dr. Eric Wallace candidate for District 40, Major Ben Bielry, District 43, and Chris Kaspersky, District 31. They will each file tomorrow morning. The Red Wave in November will take them to the statehouse.      Had a pretty cool police event scheduled in Champaign tomorrow, but was cancelled for weather. Have a half dozen events scheduled in next 2 weeks, and looking forward to them. Writing Immigration paper. Read a great book by Brian Kilmeade entitled ""Sam Houston & the Alamo Avengers - The Texas history that changed American history."" It's a good read.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-11-27 00:38:53,"Filed with the Illinois State Board of Elections for United States Senator yesterday with my petitions. Have many, many more signatures than required, and am grateful to the 150+ volunteers and Cor team!      This last weekend was inspiring and emotional almost beyond words, but I'll try. Last July, President Trump and the late civil rights leader Rep. Elisha Cummings (RIP) got into a war of words over the filthy and unhealthy conditions in Baltimore. Enter Scott Pressler, conservative activist who shows the love by organizing trash clean up events. With his own money he rented 3 commercial trash bins and organized volunteers through social media for ""Clean Up Baltimore.""  With more than 200 volunteers, 12 tons of trash were picked up in 12 hours. Scott organized another Clean Up in Baltimore and one in Los Angeles. The residents of these neighborhoods and even the homeless helped with the efforts. Saturday was Clean Up Chicago.        Pastor Cory Brooks is the founder of New Beginnings Church in Woodlawn, a community in South Chicago with one of the highest crime rates. He and his church are highly respected. Businesses including McDonalds and Walgreens left the area, but Pastor Brooks is holding the line and making progress with Project HOOD (Helping Others Obtain Destiny). HOOD has raised 2.9 M of a 25M goal. The Walgreens store has been converted into a beautiful space for employment and small business support, health and exercise, and community safety. Pastor Brooks is a quiet and humble man who has a mission and a vision which is being realized in South Chicago. The Clean Up Chicago event began at the beautiful HOOD facility.        Scott had groups of volunteers coming in at 2 hour intervals. Each group was divided into smaller groups with specific areas of the neighborhood assigned. My group was assigned to 63rd and Prairie. We picked up about 20 bags of trash and I found a bicycle that was in repairable condition. Overall, 250+ volunteers picked up 7 tons of trash. To a person, every resident of the neighborhood who passed by said thank you, and one young man carried our bags to the pick-up point. My leg muscles were sore for a few days as a reminder of the most fulfilling day I have had in a long time.       My son Andrei and I met Pastor Brooks for 30 minutes after our work hours. He invited me to his church and offered to introduce me to other Black Pastors in Chicago. I told him that I will work and talk with anyone. He said that if you want Black support ""just show up."" This is the first of many visits to Black communities in Chicago. I asked him to say a prayer for me and the campaign, and my son and I and Pastor Brooks held hands. Thank you Pastor Brooks! Thank you Scott Pressler! I will earn the honor of representing  all Illinois citizens in the Senate.      On Sunday, after meeting with my team in Palatine on petitions, we returned to Springfield where I met with families who endure the pain of losing a wife, a son and a brother to illegal immigrants with histories prior criminal offenses. I am devoting this weekend to my immigration policy paper, which is nearly complete. I am going to tell you about every family in separate posts. They deserve this and every platform to tell the truth of how sanctuary laws make our communities unsafe. Your hearts will break for these neighbors of ours.       The tide is turning. We The People are fed up. Black America is turning to Trump. Sanctuary laws will someday be a thing of the past. Dick Durbin can't survive the frustration of Illinois citizens who are not represented by him and his radical left agenda.      We will prevail with God's help. God Bless you, and have a safe and Happy Thanksgiving. Tom",143,125,0,17,1,0,0,7,494855044708465,DrTarter,/story.php?story_fbid=494855044708465&id=387260852134552

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-11-16 23:21:24,"This was a memorable campaign day, and I‚Äôve had many great days. The day started with Madison County Day of Action in Bethalto with young Republicans who were knocking on doors to get petition signatures for candidates. I was late, but I knocked on many doors. My son Sergei was my driver today and Michael Butler helped throughout the day. Next was the Trooper Nicholas Hopkins Fundraiser in Edwardsville, partially organized by the SIU-Edwardsville Young Republicans. Trooper Hopkins was 33 years old and a 10-year veteran of the Illinois State Police. He was killed August 23 serving a warrant in East St. Louis. Trooper Hopkins‚Äô family was not present, understandably. A lot of money was raised for the family of this hero. My intent was to get petition signatures, and we got a few, but it didn‚Äôt seem appropriate, so we ate, and talked with folks. Students in the Criminal Justice Program at SIUE ran the auction. I spoke with one of them, Dillon, who is an impressive young man. His goal after graduation this year is to be an Illinois State Trooper. He attended Riverton HS and probably ran in cross country meets when my son Andrei ran for SHG. The SWAT vehicle and the Life Flight helicopter attracted all the kids and me.! I wish I had been able to meet with Trooper Hopkins‚Äô family to express what we all think and feel about such brave men and women who risk, and give, their lives every day to keep us safe.  May God Bless our police ‚Äì town, city, county, the State Police, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and all other units! Last was Trinity Lutheran Church Fish Fry in Red Bud. I am going to win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator in Illinois on March 17, and I will work 24/7 to win the general election. Despite any uncertainty, one thing is certain for me; I will always attend the Trinity Lutheran Church Fish Fry in November. This is not a campaign promise. This is a promise from my heart. I really had the best time of the entire campaign tonight with everyone at Trinity, but especially with the men in the ‚Äúshack‚Äù who were thawing, breading, and frying the fish. When I walked in with the clipboard, they were worried that I was from the Health Department. I told them I was a urologist running for the U.S. Senate. We had a great time laughing, talking, and drinking beer. Ate some fish right out of the fryer with homemade pickles.

That evening, attended Illinois State Republican Party Fall Reception. Keynote speaker was Trump campaign communications director Marc Lotter. He has also served as special assistant to the President and Press Secretary for Vice President Pence. (first pic).      Friday worked on fundraising and in the evening attended Illinois Right to Life banquet. Jeanne Ives was the MC, and syndicated conservative pro-life talk show host Matt Walsh was keynote speaker.

The banquet was attended by about 800 Christians, the majority evangelicals. I ran into many who I have met on the campaign trail. I was delighted that the Executive Director, David E.

He also made it clear that the pastors need to be involved in the election for Donald Trump and Republican pro-life candidates. Great evening!     Saturday spoke to Lake County Republicans. Then celebrated Grand Opening of CorStrategies new office in Inverness. Beautiful space and great organization.       This evening, my son Sergei and I attended the Washington County Republican Century Club Dinner in Okawville.  Washington County is home to incredible and venerable Illinois Republican leaders. Charles Meier, State Representative of 108th District, gave a summary of success his district despite the challenge of being in the minority party. Fifth District Appellate Justices David Overstreet and Mark Boie spoke about their campaigns.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-11-01 02:05:38,"Plans for impeachment of our great President Donald J. Trump, were announced 19 hours after his inauguration. The House introduced articles of impeachment in 2017, which failed. The Russia collusion Muller investigation lasted 675 days. There were 2800 subpoenas, 500 witness depositions, and requests for information from 13 foreign countries. The investigation cost 40 million dollars. Articles of impeachment were promised, but then, there was no collusion. Now impeachment 3.0 or 4.0, hard to keep count. Remarkably, the President has accomplished more for every American and for our country than most Presidents.  Polling in swing states of Wisconsin. Michigan. Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina show 52% against impeachment and 43% for. Elections are won by states. There is going to be a Red wave throughout the heartland of America. After I win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator in Illinois, I will ride that wave into the United States Senate.  The sham impeachment ""inquiry"" is a gift from the Democrat Party for us to have a United Republican government.

The husband is a business owner and his wife is a teacher. We talked for a half hour, and they have serious concerns about the cost of healthcare, and of our politics. Nice young family with very patient young children and an impatient dog. I would love to represent this family and all families in Illinois in the U.S. Senate.

Pics are from Naperville Township Republican Organization meeting Thursday night, Park Ridge Republican Women brunch with Congressman Darin LaHood on Saturday, and Sycamore Pumpkin Festival Parade on Sunday. There were 100,000 spectators. I introduced myself and shook hands with hundreds. My banner and I were at the front of a block-long Republican crowd of candidates and supporters.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-10-19 00:28:29,"FEC report shows that of Republican candidates who have filed, I have most cash on hand, even after hiring polling firm and political team. Great week of fundraising, and two fundraisers scheduled.      Took a week of vacation and on the trail all week. Campaigned Iin Hancock, DuPage, Cook, Lake, Will, and Peoria Counties. Met with GOP organizations in the evenings, and worked for petition signatures at meetings, and at commuter train stations in Palatine, Schaumburg and .Barrington Villages.     So much to tell, but this post is to thank George Pearson, GOP Chairman of Will County. When I was contemplating this campaign, I wrote to, and called, every County GOP Chairperson. Of all who took my call, George Pearson spoke with me the longest. He listened, and he caused me to think about what was driving me, aside from healthcare. The next morning, I wrote it all out, and developed the pillars of my campaign. Like he said, the poles of a tent.      Our conversation was last June. Since then, I have been to GOP events in dozens of counties and townships.  Last night, I was finally able to meet with the Will County GOP. Like my initial conversation, George, he wanted every candidate vetted with questions. It was an incredible meeting.      This post is a shout out to George Pearson, Chairman of Will County GOP because of his leadership and honesty. He helped me at the very beginning by challenging me, and I am grateful. He holds candidates accountable. He is also a very humble and genuine man. I don't have a pic of him and me from last night, which is my bad.

Glad to pay, because medicine has given me and my family a good life. If you take out a loan, then pay it off! Student loan manufactured ""crisis"" solved!       A lot of ""lasts"" recently.

After 29 years, no more 3 AM calls and crawling out of bed to treat a person with a urological emergency. I thought I would be more emotional about the ""lasts"" than I am, because I love the work and I'm good at it.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-09-29 19:37:44,"Attended Schaumburg Township Republican Organization breakfast with my son Sergei yesterday morning. Four candidates for U.S. Senate got petition signatures and gave 2 minute talks. Thought mine went very well. Thank you Joseph Folisi, Republican Township Committeeman for a truly great meeting. The Township is run by Republicans. Learned that only 1.7% of property taxes go to Townships. I also learned about the services provided including snow plowing in the unincorporated areas, and mental health, veteran and senior services. It is impressive. Townships provide the best bang for the taxpayer buck. No wonder that their existence is threatened by the larger governmental bodies. The best and least costly services are provided by our neighbors, who care the most. Republican controlled Townships also stay within their budgets.      In the afternoon, we attended the Southwest Suburban Republican picnic. Thank you Sean Morrison for a fun event despite the rain. Spirits were not dampened at all. With witch hunt 2.0, the energy was high. Cook County candidates gave inspiring talks. Candidates got a lot of petition signatures and there was a Food Truck with Chicago hot dogs! Met a lot of great Cook County Republicans. I get so pumped up that I wasn't even tired after drive home to Springfield      Today my sons Andrei and Sergei helped me get petition signatures at the annual Springfield Route 66 car show. Andrei got a pic of me leaning into a green Challenger getting signatures. My boys have a talent for taking pictures of my back end.       My sons Andrei, Nikolai, and Sergei were adopted as infants from Russia. They are fine young men. I love my Russia connections! HA!      Enjoyed Mark Curran's company at both events, and we get along well. He even complimented Sergei.

Met with honor flight veterans. In afternoon went to Block Party in Springfield sponsored by a Republican P.C. Great company and conversations. Party was in front of Linden Elementary school, which was purchased by Fred Conaway, owner of Central Illinois Sign Company. Some areas of the school are 100 years old. The building is in perfect shape. Mr. Conaway attended Linden Elementary as a child.  Now his union employees print posters in the library and assemble huge digital signs in the auditorium/gymnasium. Really creative.       Sunday went to McLean County Republicans picnic. Darin LaHood and Rodney Davis were there. Mark Curran and I gave talks.

Folks from every political persuasion, race, etc in Decatur participate in Civic life, and I love it! These are citizens who have traditions and who are proud of their city. Whether it is an outdoor concert, a holiday parade, a Cancer Survivors dinner, or a political gathering, there is always a crowd. I really love working in Decatur, and I admire the Civic pride. The first pic is a major contributor and supporter of my campaign, Mr. Lou Golden, with my son Sergei at the picnic. Lou is an incredible retired business owner.       Friday was prostate cancer screening day in my clinic. Again, it's Decatur, so around 200 men came in for a free prostate cancer screening. The Carpenters Union, DMH and Cancer Care Specialists of Illinois were the major sponsors. THANK YOU!!  Men who have a family history of prostate cancer  and African American men are the high risk targeted grouos for screening. My brother died of prostate cancer, and I am a prostate cancer survivor, so every prostate cancer screening day is important to me. .Second pic shows  Decatur urologists Dr. Blackwell and Dr. Kottwitz and my nurse practitioner, Nicole Soper.

Gross Domestic Product is above 3% and the unemployment rate is less than 4%. The unemployment rate among African Americans and Hispanics is the lowest ever recorded. The United States leads the world in wages and salary growth. Illinois state revenue increased by 1.5 billion dollars in 2018 as a direct result of the tax cuts.

The U.S. is spending millions on rescue and recovery efforts for our neighbors in the Bahamas after the devastation. Already 1500 Bahamians who have documents have been welcomed into our country  on temporary visas, and more will follow. Our President made it clear that every Bahamian entering our country needs to be vetted. Our great compassion will extend mostly to bringing aid to the people of the Bahamas in their Homeland. Durbin's statement that he wants TPS and work visas for Bahamians is a cynical pandering to illegal aliens and groups who support them, rather than the rule of law. Durbin took an oath to protect the Constitution and laws of our country, but he encourages illegal immigration. I am wrapping up my white paper on immigration for the campaign web site.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-09-08 21:27:02,"Great weekend starting with Decatur Seniorama. Then to training session at Lincoln Land CC for Precinct Committeeman (PC) and Candidate Training. My young son Sergei is a newly sworn PC. Then we drove to DeKalb County for the Sandwich Fair. Sandwich, Illinois is small, but the fair in size and attendance rivals the State Fairs. It is an amazing, crowded spectacle. Met many wonderful people. I made a $5 contribution to the pig raffle, and should I win, the unlucky pig goes to a food bank. The organizer gave me the microphone to introduce myself and campaign,  which led to an hour of conversations. Met with Republicans in tent and a man I met, Kenneth Reed, gave me a Christian humor book he wrote. Many people signed my petition. Today, Sergei and I went the the Dundee Township picnic. Jeanie Ives and Evelyn Sanguineti were the big draw because they are both running for Representative of the 6th Congressional District. I was given an opportunity to speak and 3 of my competitors also gave talks It was a very nice event with organizers, candidates and elected officials. A video of my talk was recorded, and I'll  post when available. Need to be a doctor next 4 days, but have 3 evening events and another full weekend coming up. Patients first until fully retired after December. Doing my best.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-09-02 21:38:07,"America's laborers and union members are on my mind today. Hope all had a nice Labor Day and really . I would have campaigned at Labor Day parade, but went to a memorial service of a woman who died at age 86 instead. My wife and her were very close a few years back through non-profit fundraising. She was an artist, and one of her beautiful paintings has the place of honor in our living room. Her life was well-lived. Reconnected with dear friends at the service. But getting back to Labor, was at Du Quoin State Fair on Saturday. Went to AFL-CIO tent and spoke with representatives of Electrical Workers. They may never know how much I admire them and every man and woman in the trades. My young brother, Michael Tarter, was in the construction trade, and was killed on site from an accident. I can't thank his union enough for their support of his family..Thank God he had the union! I told the Electrical Workers, who get their health care through their union, exactly what the plan for a government takeover of their health care will mean for them. Contracts negotiated over decades go poof! No enthusiastic endorsement from them, but these things take time. I honor our laborers!

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-08-30 20:49:06,"This beautiful sunset is on my.mind tonight. The sunstets of our lives should be on all of our minds. There are a lot of levels here. First are my dear friends who have life-threatening illnesses. Brain cancer in one and Lewy body dementia in another. I love them so much, and the sun may be setting on their lives. God willing, with our best health care system in the entire world they, can hang on until the next development, which is around the corner. In terms of cancer, survivorship has increased year after year since 1971 in the U.S. I love you my dear friends. Keep fighting. Another level of the sunset is the baby boomer generation. My generation.  I have taken care of seniors all of my career. Who will take care of us on the government plan if Dick Durbin is re-elected?  I worry about this so much that I am more dedicated than ever to defeat him.  Under his plan, my friends will be given end-of-life counseling and no further care. The rest of us can decide if we want to travel to Mexico or India for high-quality affordable specialty care. The sun is setting , but hopefully not on those we love. And hopefully not on all Americans who value their health care and do not want to be forced into an inferior government plan. The most beautiful sunset that we can all enjoy will be on Dick Durbin's endless time in Congress.",76,61,0,15,0,0,0,4,430100274517276,DrTarter,/story.php?story_fbid=430100274517276&id=387260852134552

My only real competition on GOP primary is Mark Curran, former Sheriff of.Lake County. He first ran as a Dem, then switched to GOP in 2008. He had 3 terms until 2018 when he lost his re-election bid. Trump was not popular in the suburbs then, and Curran did not support the President and said his department would not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He swore to uphold the law and the Constitution, and then chose to abandon his oath for politics. He says his Bishop convinced him. Mark Curran is no more Catholic than I am, and I believe in the rule of law. Curran, like Durbin who also supports illegal immigration, is a career politician. The poor guy is out of work, and he says he doesn't need to do this. Like Trump, I'm giving up a job I love in order to do this.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-08-01 22:22:50,"Military members are on my mind tonight. Last night I met with Dr. Robert Taylor, USMC Colonel, retired. Dr. Taylor has a PhD in psychology, and teaches at Richland CC. He was the Director of Safety for the Marine Corps during Desert Storm. He now serves as the Illinois Council President of the Military Officers Association of America. The MOAA advocates for military members, both active and retired. Our military is a volunteer force. Recruitment and retention are significant issues, especially retention. Major retention issues are the ""Ops tempo,""  that is, the length and frequency of deployment. Another is the poor quality of life in off-base housing. Finally, family support during deployment needs to improve. Why would families of deployed military need SNAP (food stamp) support? Promises are made at the time of recruitment, but they are not kept with retirement and health care benefits. The pension plan is changing, for better or worse. Health care is a moving target. Benefits need to stabilize if we hope to retain a volunteer military. The final lesson for me, and I hope for you, is that those members who leave military service are NOT damaged. Yes, some have suffered PTSD and other injuries, and need compassion and the best care. But the media perception of drug abuse and homelessness does not apply to the vast majority. Most are well-trained, clean, respectful, hard-working, and punctual. They are of all races. They are our veterans, and they have specific issues, such as the widow's tax that Congress has not dealt with in 15 years! Enough! Thank you Dr. Taylor for a free education on our great volunteer military.members, active and retired. Thank you for being such a good officer to your men and women during your retirement from active military service. I'm sorry that 'thank you for your service"" can sound hollow.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-07-29 01:04:15,"Lake County Fair today. The most extensive 4H exhibit so far. Wonderful animal and physical science, crafts, and art exhibits, and lots of ribbons. We have a great and exciting future! My son, Andrei got a massage in a total immersion chair. Cost is 12K. So moving on, we found the Republicans. The Party is highly organized. Democrat booth was deserted, and no Durbin sign. Met many candidates and elected officials. First pic is a young Hispanic HS student organizer and Valerie Ramirrz- Mukherjee, who is running for Congress in the 10th Congressional District. Valerie is a Cal Berkeley grad and has impressive political experience. She is also a down to earth family woman. The second pic is group photo of candidates and elected officials. Thank you Lake County Republican Chairman Mark Shaw for a fun time with candidates and organizers at the fair.",49,45,0,4,0,0,0,3,410724426454861,DrTarter,/story.php?story_fbid=410724426454861&id=387260852134552
Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-07-27 23:48:52,"In DuPage County. Visited with Party officials at Republican tent at county Fair. Didn't see a Democrat tent. Marty Keller, Chairman of DuPage County Republican Party wasn't in the tent. He was at the CERT site. More education for the next U.S. Illinois Senator! Mr. Keller is also the Executive Director of the Milton Township Community Emergency Response Team. As  a Department of Homeland Security entity, he must keep politics separate. CERT, which was started in 1993, educates and trains volunteers about disaster preparedness. Professional responders rely on CERT volunteers during disasters so they can focus on more complex tasks. Go on line and consider being a CERT volunteer in your community! The training is intense and lasts about 7 weeks. God Bless this great country and our incredible CERT volunteers.

Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-07-26 23:46:51,"Sangamon Republicans raised a lot of money yesterday at the annual golf outing. Met with a lot of great Republicans, and reminded them, that after 19 years of supporting Sangamon County candidates (with a lot of time and treasure), that I am their favorite son My son Andrei and I went to Champaign County Fair tonight. No political party booths, but met with Robin VanDiver, the new Commander of the Champaign County American Legion Post. Commander VanDiver is a great American. She is disabled from her service. She taught me a lot about surprise medical bills from private physician groups that accept VA referals. I can honestly say that my group doesn't do that. SHAMEFUL! I will make this illegal as your  U.S. Senator! Robin also educated me on the Auxillary, and Sons of the American Legion organizations. Also Operation Comfort Warriors, which like the Wounded Warriors,  helps wounded soldiers, but has a 0% overhead cost. Thank you Commander VanDiver for your wonderful service and for my education this evening!  President Trump is helping our Veterans, and I will help him as your Senator.",89,81,0,8,0,0,0,3,409542249906412,DrTarter,/story.php?story_fbid=409542249906412&id=387260852134552
Dr. Tom Tarter,,2019-07-21 23:04:12,"Went to Kane County Fair yesterday with my son Sergei. He's a great volunteer for the campaign. He was sworn in as a Republican Precinct Committeeman, so I have to call him Honorable Sergei Tarter. No one calls me doctor at home when I am folding clothes. The Kane County Republican Party is very active. The poor Democrat booth was a lonely scene. I met with elected officials including State Representative Dan Ugast from District 65. I met with party officials including Laura Pollastrini who is the Secretary of the Kane County Western Townships and Illinois Republican State Central Committeeman for the 14th District. I met the Republican Candidates for Congressman in the 14th District, all great Republicans. I met with the Kane County Young Republicans, and they are very committed and working hard. I was able to convey details of my campaign for HEALTH, SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY. Sergei and I had a wonderful time in beautiful Kane County.",83,72,0,11,0,0,0,7,406641716863132,DrTarter,/story.php?story_fbid=406641716863132&id=387260852134552
