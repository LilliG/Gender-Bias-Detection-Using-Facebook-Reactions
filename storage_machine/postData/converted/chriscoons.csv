It's bittersweet for us, though, as Councilman Freel has been a steady and strong voice for us in this City's government for 26 years. Few of us don't have a story of Councilman Freel taking an interest in a problem or issue we were dealing with and then going the extra mile to help find a resolution.  It never mattered where you lived in the City, his commitment to Constituent Service compels him to respond to any Wilmingtonian who calls for help to cut through red tape or to advocate for a fix to a local issue.  His vision of committed Constituent Service also means that he is regularly taking a hard look at operational best practices from other cities that could be implemented here to make our City's government more effective.  When you work with Councilman Freel, you know you are working with a real Public Servant -- someone who is laser-focused on improving our city and helping all of its citizens because that is how we ALL rise.  We forget in this ratings-focused age that there are still people doing the heroic work of genuine Public Service.  Public service is a real calling and those who respond to that call well are valuable and rare.  It's been our privilege to have you represent us these past 26 years, Councilman Freel.
