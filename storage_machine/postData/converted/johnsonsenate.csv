Wayne Johnson for US Senate,,2020-03-05 14:41:05,"When I left the Trump administration last October to seek appointment to the U.S. Senate, I knew the time was now to elevate the debate over the student loan debt crisis shackling 44 million Americans & their families, including 1.2 million Georgians. For the past few months, I have talked to hundreds of regular Georgians who talk about the burden of student debt, debt largely created by broken Federal Student Aid model. It's a kitchen table issue for them. That's why I qualified today to be on the ballot in the unique ""jungle primary"" as a Republican who can reach across party politics and talk about the kitchen table issues facing voters in Georgia. As a fiscal conservative and businessman who worked inside the FSA program for two years, I know my Opportunity Plus plan will work. It will require compromise, leadership and bipartisanship. But it is doable. We won't spend million on negative television ads or attack other candidates. Instead, we will take the message across Georgia. There are people living with the burden of student debt in every one of Georgia's counties, and that's where I'm heading. We'll talk about those kitchen table issues like student loan debt. That may sound better to voters than a barrage of negative television and direct mail pieces. Join us. Spread the word on your digital platforms. The only way the student loan crisis gets solved is if an army of regular citizens band together.
