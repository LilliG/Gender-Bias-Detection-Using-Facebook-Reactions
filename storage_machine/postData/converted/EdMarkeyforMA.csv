Ed Markey,,2020-03-08 20:37:35,"Gender based discrimination impacts all aspects of a woman’s life from the personal to the professional and the political. We will fight for social and economic justice and guarantee women’s rights and autonomy.  Women still make 77 cents on average to a man’s dollar. Black women make 63 cents to a white man’s dollar. Latinas make 53 cents to a white man’s dollar. If we closed the gender pay gap, we could cut the poverty rate for working women and their families in half.  Women also face discrimination in the health system. Women’s pain is taken less seriously than men’s, and the concerns of women of color in particular are regularly dismissed by providers. The maternal mortality rate for black women is more than 3 times that of white women. Meanwhile, abortion access across America is in danger. After nearly 50 years of precedent, Roe v. Wade is as close as it has ever come to being rolled back and funding for reproductive healthcare services are being slashed. Women hold fewer than 25% of seats in Congress. And even though a record number of women ran for the presidency this year, we still have yet to elect our first female president.  Yet the women’s movement is stronger than ever. In 2018, a record shattering number of women ran for office–and won. They are paving the way for future female leaders and a more representative and just democracy.",68,58,0,10,0,0,0,5,2210689835701338,EdMarkeyforMA,/story.php?story_fbid=2210689835701338&id=303167829786891
Ed Markey,,2020-03-08 20:36:14,"Women are often the ones most affected by war and conflict. We will fight to stop endless wars, end nuclear proliferation, and create a free and peaceful world for all.  It is estimated that about 70% of those killed in today’s conflicts are civilians, mainly women and children. As of November 2019, 335,000 civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, and Pakistan were killed as a result of war.  Women make up the largest share of refugees and people displaced by conflict. Women in areas of conflict and displaced women are more vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse. One in five refugee women are estimated to have experienced sexual violence.  Conflict also drives gender based discrimination and inequity. During periods of violence, girls are often taken out of schools or prevented from receiving an education.  But women are leading the way toward peace. Malala Yousafzai defends girls' education in the face of war. Climate activist Jane Fonda is well known for her anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War. And closer to home, Andrea Burns and others from Massachusetts Peace Action work to promote a more just and peaceful US foreign policy.",25,18,0,2,0,5,0,0,2210688002368188,EdMarkeyforMA,/story.php?story_fbid=2210688002368188&id=303167829786891
Ed Markey,,2020-03-08 20:33:07,"Gun violence is inextricably tied to intimate partner violence and violence against women. We must commit to passing common sense gun safety legislation and universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of abusers and end gun violence. On average, 52 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner per month. Nearly 1 million American women alive today have reported being shot or shot at by an intimate partner. 4.5 million have been threatened with a gun. Women in the United States are 21 times more likely to die from firearm homicides than women in other wealthy nations.  But women are also leading the movement to end gun violence. From Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, to Congresswoman Rep. Lucy McBath, to Chaplain Clementina Chéry, women are rising up to demand an end to the epidemic of gun violence in our country.",30,26,0,4,0,0,0,1,2210684189035236,EdMarkeyforMA,/story.php?story_fbid=2210684189035236&id=303167829786891
Ed Markey,,2020-03-08 20:30:42,"Globally, women face the harshest consequences of the climate crisis. We will fight to pass a Green New Deal and stand up for environmental justice everywhere.  Environmental destruction fuels violence against women and contributes to conflicts and war. Extreme weather events disproportionately affect poor populations. Women make up 70% of the world’s poor. 80% of people displaced by climate change are women.  Pollution and contamination contribute to worsening health, particularly for women. The growing prevalence of asthma for adolescent girls is attributed to the climate crisis. Rising temperatures, food insecurity, and other symptoms of the climate crisis are linked to maternal mortality.  Women and girls are also leading the fight to combat the climate crisis. Varshini Prakash founded the Sunrise Movement. Greta Thunberg is a leader of the climate movement worldwide.

His right arm was as strong as an ox. For thirteen years, he lifted up my mother and cared for her right there in the living room. For thirteen years while I was a congressman, I helped him.

They are heroes, but even heroes need help.  That’s why I fought so hard to pass two very important bills focused on this disease. One makes sure that these families have the help they need to care for their loved ones at home. Another sets the national goal to find a cure for Alzheimer’s by 2025.

As the number of Alzheimer’s patients grows each year, more and more strain is put on families and our healthcare system. If we do not find a cure, Alzheimer's will bankrupt Medicaid and Medicare.

"Ed Markey,Paul Bo",Paul Bo,2020-02-12 20:07:31,"In 2019 I re-introduced my bill to restrict US first-use of nuclear weapons. But my history with the nuclear non-proliferation movement goes way back to my sophomore year science fair at Malden Catholic.  One day my father brought me to work with him at the Hood Milk company. There was a whole science lab set up on the roof where scientists were testing the milk for radioactive isotopes. This was back in 1962, in the middle of the Cold War.  Because of atmospheric nuclear testing by the US and USSR, strontium-90 was being deposited into the clouds. The Sr-90 would fall to the ground in rain, cows would eat contaminated grass, and Sr-90—this radioactive particle—was showing up in the milk supply.  So because of nuclear testing, children across the country and all over the planet were drinking dangerous, radioactive isotopes in their milk.  Around that time, Linus Pauling began a public health movement to persuade President Kennedy to end atmospheric nuclear testing. He was already a Nobel Prize winner. I was a high school sophomore, so the largest audience I could appeal to was the Malden Catholic science fair.  My views on nuclear proliferation and environmental contamination started right there with this science project. I saw that children were being poisoned and the government was complicit. The year after this science fair, in 1963, Khrushchev and Kennedy signed the atmospheric nuclear test ban. Underground tests were still going on—until 20 years later when I wrote and passed an amendment in Congress to shut that down.Radioactive milk, kids, and a science fair project.

Ed Markey,,2020-01-08 18:30:43,"Last night, Iran attacked air bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops and personnel. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but Donald Trump must take responsibility for the lives of our servicemembers, civilians, and allies that were put in danger with his dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran. Over the weekend, Donald Trump tweeted threats of retaliation if Iran were to strike the United States. He said that his administration has targeted 52 sites, including cultural sites, that he would hit should such an attack take place. Let me be very clear here: Attacking cultural sites is a war crime, and the Trump administration knows it. The United States Senate must act to prevent any further escalation and block Donald Trump from launching unlawful military actions. We are dangerously close to going to war with Iran when we should instead be working to put a stop to the endless wars in the Middle East. Today, I introduced a resolution condemning Trump’s threats to target cultural sites. His actions over the past week have made our country less safe.
