"Joey Camp 2020,Trish Zornio",Trish Zornio,2020-02-26 08:42:38,"Trish Zornio is TRIGGERED! She stole my photographs from the Elizabeth Warren event, then when confronted privately about it, said I was at the Elizabeth Warren event to ""stalk"" her. I'm big big confused. Here is the proof she stole the photography from the Warren event. Notice that she doesn't mention me by name, and she resorts to ""gender"" and saying that I am a ""GOP Tracker"". LMAO. https://www.joeycamp2020.com/2020/02/trish-zornio.html ~JojoRunning for office as a woman comes with unique challenges. Many weeks ago I was warned I was possibly being followed/stalked at events. A few weeks ago it began to escalate and even my opponent’s team warned me of this person in writing. At a political rally this past weekend I was targeted by this same person who wouldn’t leave me alone. Now we have incoming abusive threats every few minutes to hours from the same person because I will not respond to him or his threats. After two days and what must be hundreds of messages and fake content across multiple media platforms, today we got a glimpse of who we are dealing with. I share this not because I need help, but because I think it’s important for the public to get a glimpse of what really happens when women run for federal office. I never thought running for US Senate would be easy — I knew I’d get a GOP tracker (true), that my opponents would unfairly smear me in efforts to win (true), and that I’d put myself in a personally vulnerable position financially, emotionally, and otherwise (also true). I’m still so honored and excited to be running, and I’m working so hard to make the ballot (!), but for all the amazing things that happen and people I meet, there truly are many downright ugly experiences on the campaign trail — especially for women. Thankfully, these kind of experiences only serve to make me more passionate than ever to fight for change and especially to fight for women’s rights and safety. No man will ever keep me down! 😉  Have a great morning everyone, and in the spirit of asking for what we need, feel free to leave a little extra positive feedback to counteract. We women (and men!) have to stick together and lift each other when the going gets tough. Let’s do this — it’s caucus time!  #NeverthelessShePersisted",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,495331128083516,joeycamp2020,/story.php?story_fbid=495331128083516&id=229264031356895

Although there was much pomp and circumstance during week one, we have also been hard at work. In fact, over 90 bills have been introduced in the House and 70 in the Senate already. During opening day Speaker KC Becker spoke about the historic and productive 2019 session which saw a majority-women house of representatives leading the way on lowering the cost of health care, investing in education, tackling climate change and reforming our criminal legal system. Moving forward, the Speaker outlined an ambitious agenda for 2020 including ending capital punishment, increasing mental health support in our schools, implementing gun safety initiatives that have already been adopted on a bipartisan basis around the country, raising the legal age to buy nicotine and tobacco products to 21 and passing a fiscally sustainable paid family leave program. Governor Jared Polis gave a bold State of the State address that addressed many of the issues that I have been championing. These measures include reforming our broken bail system, making college more affordable and expanding mental health and substance use services to those who need it.  I look forward to working with Governor Polis and leaders in both chambers on our shared priorities, including:   - Making college attainable  - Investing in preschool and K-12 education  - Taking action on every front to address the opioid epidemic  - Lowering the cost of prescription drugs  - Reforming our bail and pretrial system  - Enacting Paid Family Leave for all Coloradans  - Increasing renewable energy As always, most of my legislative initiatives come from you, including upcoming legislation to ban discrimination on the basis of hairstyle and require insurance companies to cover treatment for infertility.  There are many more bills to come. Follow me on twitter and facebook for legislative updates and announcements of community events. Thank you for your support.

According to Wheat Ridge Police Department Defective Detective Mark Slavsky if you ""Attempt to Influence"" by means of threats of litigation you are guilty of this offense. Does ""influencing"" public servants by means of being a viable spoiler in the election, meaning that the campaigns for the major party public servants will suffer economic reprisal -by having to deal with me- mean that I am committing a crime? This is why this Colorado law is unconstitutional. It prohibits lawful, and constitutional activities such as telling a cop that you will sue them if they don't do their job correctly. It also only criminalizes the ""attempt"" and not if you actually do the act without first ""threatening"" to do so. The act alone is completely lawful.

The Senate needs 2/3rds of the senators to vote to get you out of office, but only a simple majority to set forth each rule of your trial. The rules must be created before the impeachment articles are sent to the Senate, because Mitch will rig the trial as best he can as soon as he gets the articles. The delay is not illegal, and therefore not obstruction. It is because the Senate might easily pass favorable rules for your trial -such as secret voting casts by senators-before the articles get to the Senate. Taking the secret voting example, if the Senate approves the rule for secret voting -it needs only a simple majority to pass the resolution- then you are toast. Republicans will not have to worry about party politics when they vote you out of office. So, delay? Sure. Obstruction? Not so much. Dumb? Only your echo chamber base who blindly follow your nonsense. The reality is, the simple majority setting rules before the impeachment articles are sent to the Senate means that even with the Senate being majority Republicans, you are very much in danger of being removed from office.

Joey Camp 2020,,2019-12-26 10:55:48,"I get a lot of criticism, and correction, by virtue of just speaking out against the hipocracy I see in politics and public officials. I don't try and censor my critics. Instead I allow multiple viewpoints to influence my decisions, and when someone says something I don't agree with I try to learn why. Many people follow my personal profiles whose positions I will never come around to. I have had many good laughs with them. They critique my satire, and I critique their political positions with satire. We have widely divergent positions, as wide a gap as you can image, yet, in a clutch a private message to them, or me from them, will set in motion the helping hands of a neighbor. In talent management, a job I am very good at, maybe one of the best in Colorado, I have learned that people don't like the constructive criticism which I offer, and they block me often. Which is unfortunate because my track record of success is better than theirs. A few simple changes that I have learned and offer could easily advance their careers in talent quicker and more effectively. Why people don't like criticism is beyond me. So when others offer criticism, I want to learn. I don't take it as a negative, or an insult. Here is a tweet that puts it into perspective. ~Joey ""[M]y mom always said the people who love you will correct you.. so be open to criticism, apologize and put pride aside, learn from each other, grow together.. watch things fall in place when you humble yourself. I’m on this journey too... the key to accepting criticism well is reflection.. at first you’re gonna be in denial and most likely hurt but take some time to really think through it.. everything in life is about growth"" ~Adri via Twitter",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,448634526086510,joeycamp2020,/story.php?story_fbid=448634526086510&id=229264031356895
