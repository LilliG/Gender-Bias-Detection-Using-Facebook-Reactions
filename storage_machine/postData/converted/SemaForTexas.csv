Although I've addressed this many times before, Centrists roll out the same false argument whenever their favorite candidates are in trouble. So let's discuss it again, with real facts: In 2016, I supported Bernie Sanders, and no one else. After the November election, party operatives and pundits were urging protests, ballot recounts, and electoral challenges. Bernie was one of the few people ready to move on. Like most of you, I was depressed by the 2016 election results. Bernie's words in the article gave me hope, and they inspired me to keep fighting for reform, to save lives and the planet. So, in an inartful Facebook post, I attempted to share Bernie's sentiment in my own sarcastic, hyperbolic manner. Even Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi shared Bernie's optimism and thought they could work with Trump. As we all know now, Trump broke every populist promise he made during his 2016 campaign and only Bernie has held him accountable instead of enabling him like Democratic leadership. Trump never had my support despite what a union busting primary opponent has been spreading. I ask you to trust those who know me and have supported and endorsed our campaign and have built coalitions with me for the last 4 years.‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶ø ‡¶™‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶Æ ‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶è‡¶á ‡¶≠‡¶ø‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶ì‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶Ø‡¶•‡ßá‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡•§ ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ñ‡ßÅ‡¶® ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßÄ ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶ø ‡¶π‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡ßá",66,45,0,21,0,0,0,6,773734636484197,SemaForTexas,/story.php?story_fbid=773734636484197&id=192655561258777

Many more were reportedly refused entry to the United States due to a lack of capacity for Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) to detain them. Other Iranian-Americans are about to cross the Peace Arch Border as they return back to their homes in the United States from an Iranian pop concert that was taking place on Saturday in Vancouver, Canada.

Prior to 9/11 the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) was under the jurisdiction of the DOJ (Department of Justice). After 9/11 during George W. Bush first term and with a bipartisan effort, the Department of Homeland Security was born with the added bonus of the Patriot Act. The DOHS (Department of Homeland Security) is under the Executive Branch like all other agencies. In order to treat immigrants as enemy combatants, Congress moved immigration from the DOJ to DOHS. Because the DOJ operates independently of the President, the President could not oppress immigrants when the DOJ oversaw immigration. Now that Homeland Security enforces immigration law, a President can impose oppressive policies, such as family separation. We must abolish ICE by returning immigration enforcement and oversight to the DOJ. That will limit the risk that a renegade President such as Trump can harm refugees and others seeking a new life in our country. Knowledge is power.
