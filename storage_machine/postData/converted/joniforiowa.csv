To kick things off -Iowa has the longest serving Governor in the history of America, the great Terry Branstad. First Lady Lou Henry Hoover was born in Waterloo in 1874. She was the first First Lady to make regular radio broadcasts and is still the only First Lady to have been fluent in an Asian language. She was also the first woman in America to earn a degree in geology from Stanford. Growing up, former Tonight Show host Johnny Carson lived in Corning, Avoca, Clarinda and my hometown of Red Oak. Correctionville got its name because that is where land surveyors adjusted (or corrected) their survey lines for the curvature of the Earth. It has nothing to do with a prison, nor is there a local correctional facility. Iowans are known for our service defending America, and during World War II, the Des Moines Ordnance Plant in Ankeny manufactured up to nearly four billion bullets. The site of that plant is now the John Deere Des Moines Works. Strawberry Point is the home of America's largest strawberry! There are more hogs in Iowa than there are people in New York City (the jokes write themselves). There are more chickens in Iowa than people in Texas and California COMBINED. Cornell College is one of only two schools in the country that has its entire campus on the National Register of Historic Places. My alma mater Iowa State was the first land grant college in the country. Go Clones!  We all know Iowa feeds and fuels the world, but did you know 92% of land in Iowa is farmland? And finally, riding through our beautiful countryside is one of the best things about our state, so it‚Äôs no surprise Iowa has the third highest motorcycle ownership in the country.
