I was not invited to participate, and our campaign team has attempted to reach out to numerous party affiliates who have not returned our correspondence.

We need changes in this country like getting corporate money out of politics, and building a more robust democratic system.  Those who benefit from corporate donations shouldn't be the ones who decide who gets to speak to voters. As younger generations enter the political scene with different ideas, experiences, and approaches, they should be welcomed to participate, rather than silenced and excluded when it doesn’t fit the agenda of party bosses.

It will importantly also allow us to transition workers freed from inefficient jobs to meaningful work.

Matlock for Kansas,,2020-01-15 15:12:07,"Kansas was founded as a free state, a safe haven for the enslaved trying to escape their oppressors. Freedmen, Wyandots, and white settlers worked together to ensure slavery would not prevail in Kansas. When I launched my campaign, I held the event at the historic Quindaro Townsite, which had been a stop on the underground railroad to help slaves escape from the slave state across the river. When I speak of Kansas values, this is the spirit I am invoking, and to me, the Kansas spirit of a safe and welcoming land lives on to this day. Today, we must all continue to work together to see that our immigrant friends and neighbors are able to feel safe and prosper. Personally, I have many friends in the immigrant community. When I considered what my immigration policy would entail, I reached out directly to those who have had to interact with our immigration system. My immigration policy is currently, and will continue to be, informed by their needs. In the spirit of the Kansas value of lending a hand to our neighbors: ICE needs to be abolished or at least seriously defunded and restructured. The main function of the organization today is to round up folks who are already living here, and that is not consistent with Kansas values. Unauthorized border crossing should be amended from a criminal offense to a civil one. My entire domestic policy prioritizes Kansans who are struggling, and I acknowledge that immigrants and refugees are struggling so much in their respective countries of origin that they are willing to uproot their lives to find something better for themselves and their families. This does not sound like a crime to me. DACA needs to be extended to the new generation of young immigrants who currently have no protection from deportation. If you came here as a child, if you grew up and went to school here, then you’re as much a part of this country as I am, and our policy needs to reflect that. You should have a painless path to citizenship immediately available to you. The Public Charge rule should be abolished. As a socialist, I reject the premise of a system that determines the merits of a person based on their economic status. The Public Charge rule is openly classist and it is time we see it for what it is. There is currently a bond imposed for folks seeking asylum. This means if you’re fleeing danger in your country of origin, you must pay the US Government $1500 to avoid immediate deportation. This is not how asylum should work. The United States championed asylum laws after WWII, and now we impose a ransom on those who are not safe in their home states.  This, also, is in consistent with Kansas values. It should be assumed that asylum seekers are not in the best financial situation, and we should take pride in our ability to support and protect them.  This is just a sampling of my immigration policy. This is an issue that is extremely important to me and I will continue to be a champion for compassionate policies that help folks rather than hurting them.",14,10,0,4,0,0,0,1,151174956322836,MatlockForSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=151174956322836&id=104868924286773

Stripping healthcare away from poor people and scapegoating immigrants are not Kansas values, and Trumpism continues to be unpopular with the hundreds of thousands of Good Neighbor Republicans in Kansas.  In the 2016 Presidential primary, only 23% of Kansas Republicans voted for Trump to be their nominee, and I don't believe that support has increased since, as indicated by the 2018 Gubernatorial race where Laura Kelly wiped the floor with Trump stooge Kris Kobach.  Kansas Republicans understand that we've had decades of rising costs while wages have remained stagnant, and they're looking for someone who is going to offer real-world solutions that make their lives better, rather than the scapegoating and finger pointing that is happening instead.

Matlock for Kansas,,2020-01-11 10:55:28,"When folks in this country are unemployed, it isn’t because there isn’t enough work to be done. As we look around our communities, there are endless projects to take on – dilapidated housing, care work of every type, beautification of our town squares, increasing access to healthy foods – but the money to start these projects always seems just out of reach as our local governments scramble to find money to keep the basic infrastructure in place. Meanwhile, Federal money is being used to shower already wealthy corporations and pay for endless wars. It is time we put that money to work in our communities. A Federally funded, locally administered job guarantee would put the resources in our hands to prioritize the things we need done and build an economy that works for us. The local administration of this program will focus on the democratization of our workforce. Sometimes when we tell people about the job guarantee, we hear “what about the people who don’t want to work?”. We believe that people DO want to work, but there currently aren’t positions that fit their physical, mental, or socioeconomic needs. In urban areas, good paying jobs are highly competitive. Even with a Bachelor’s degree, finding a job can itself be a full-time job. Furthermore, finding a position that fits your skills AND pays enough to afford your exorbitant student loan debt is next to impossible. In low-income urban areas, there are often no jobs available.  Capital has a tendency to concentrate, and that is exactly what happened in our urban areas. As our cities began to suburbanize, corporations moved out of low-income neighborhoods so they could be closer to the hip neighborhoods that were attracting college educated young people. This disinvestment has especially caused Black neighborhoods to be without decent paying jobs. Folks often work 2 or 3 minimum wage jobs just to keep the lights on. Rural towns around Kansas mostly sprung to life in the mid-late 1800s, as there was money to be made in fossil fuels, minerals, or farming. Many of those towns were left to die after big industry stripped the resources from the ground and moved on to the next opportunity. Farming towns have fared a little better than oil, coal, lead, and zinc towns, but we have started to see a shift to less prosperity in those communities as well, as our farming system continues to commodify. Folks in our rural communities often drive 30+ miles per day to find work in a plant or factory in the nearest commerce district, only to then have their tax dollars are extracted by the company who is incorporated in another state or country. Over the next few months, we look forward to talking with folks throughout Kansas communities to further discuss what types of jobs might be appealing to them as we begin to re-envision our economy. It is essential we start having these conversation and understand what the infrastructure should look like. We know our economy ebbs and flows, and the current growth cycle will eventually come to a halt. In a recession, when many lose their jobs, a job guarantee would make sure people can continue contributing and earning. Once the economy gets back to normal, the private companies can hire back. Rather than be unemployed during rough times, we can keep working on the things we decide are important in our communities. These jobs will pay a living wage. If the jobs are worth doing, they are worth paying people enough to live on. This will help stabilize prices to avoid both deflation and inflation. Providing a price floor at a living wage and maintaining stable employment will provide fewer fluctuations in the economy, and the set wage will avoid bidding up prices against the private sector. The job guarantee will allow for a just transition of the economy. When fossil fuel energy workers are displaced by the transition to sustainable energy, and insurance and billing workers are displaced by Medicare for All, the job guarantee ensures that those people continue to have meaningful jobs in our communities. It’s time we turn our Unemployment Offices into Employment Offices!",20,13,0,7,0,0,0,0,149440546496277,MatlockForSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=149440546496277&id=104868924286773

There are plenty in both parties who go to war on cheap suspicions and political points or for control of resources and spare no expense in their military campaigns. They are suddenly 'broke' when our veterans come back, and lose their humanitarian hearts when refugees of war come to our doorsteps.  The candidates we need and that the mitary personnel trust are the ones who take seriously the cost of human lives and take great lengths to avoid armed conflicts, and are most committed to taking care of our veterans and of refugees of war torn countries.   I applaud Bernie that he has shown himself committed to avoid putting our family members lives on the line in endless conflict and most supportive of taking care of vets when they get back home.

It is run by some good neighbors who are pitchin in to meet needs in that community.

We understand that many of you cannot afford to donate more than a few bucks, and we appreciate anything you're able to offer. For anyone who is able to donate a little more, please do so on behalf of all those who can't.
