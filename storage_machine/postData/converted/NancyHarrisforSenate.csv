"Nancy Harris for US Senate,David Manson,Idaho Democratic Discussion","David Manson,Idaho Democratic Discussion",2020-02-28 10:27:28,"More liberal speak please!“Traditional liberalism traces its intellectual roots to John Stuart Mill, John Locke, the Social Gospel movement and the New Deal. This liberalism believes in gaining power the traditional way: building coalitions, working within the constitutional system and crafting the sort of compromises you need in a complex, pluralistic society. This is why liberals like Hubert Humphrey, Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Warren were and are such effective senators. They worked within the system, negotiated and practiced the art of politics... Liberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism. Liberalism is horrified by cruelty. (It eschews rather than) embodies the populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarization, a demand for ideological purity among your friends and incessant hatred for your supposed foes. A liberal leader confronts new facts and changes his or her mind. A populist leader cannot because the omniscience of the charismatic headman can never be doubted. A liberal sees shades of gray. For a populist reality is white or black, friend or enemy. Facts that don’t fit the dogma are ignored. A liberal sees inequality and tries to reduce it. A populist sees remorseless class war and believes in concentrated power to crush the enemy”",7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,1248757465318348,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1248757465318348&id=958504471010317

We were instructed to be quiet spread out and try to stay out of sight. We found an area behind a building, we stood against the wall and inched our  way toward the fence where we had a good view of what has started being called “The Boxcars in the Sky” A Charter Airline, I couldn’t see the name, ready for boarding. I could see men Shaking out shackles laying them out ready to be put on. There were about 3 buses parked partially out of sight  Since I am short I was able to get up close to the fence and those behind could see over my head I pressed my eye close to an opening in the fence and watched  Very soon they came!!!! Men, Shuffling to the bottom of the steps. I saw them being patted down and then they climbed the steps to board the plane. I started to count #1-2-3-4-5 Once I started to count I couldn’t stop. One by one I witnessed each one with a number. They kept coming my brothers then my sisters  The longer I counted,  the tears began to cloud my vision and I had to blink them away.

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2020-01-31 18:00:15,"Dear Friends: Today’s vote to deny testimony from key witnesses to be heard before the Senate in the impeachment trial is an affront to American democracy. Fundamental fairness requires that the Senate must weigh all evidence relevant to the case at hand. Denying witnesses and blocking the request of documents from congressional subpoenas is a shameless attempt to suppress critical evidence and subvert justice. A fair and impartial trial is impossible without a complete record of the evidence. If the President were to be acquitted on an incomplete record of evidence and without testimony from key witnesses under oath, then the acquittal would be an empty verdict that would leave a stain on our democratic institutions and would do nothing to exonerate this President of gross misconduct.  The denial of witnesses and blocking of evidentiary documents is an embarrassment to the long history of the Senate and marks an inexcusable departure from procedural precedent. In the 231-year history of the US Senate, there have been 15 full completed impeachment trials, and in every single one of those trials the Senate heard testimony from witnesses. A sham impeachment trial lacking witnesses and based on an incomplete record of evidence will leave the United States with a rogue president who accepts no consequences for his alleged illegal and corrupt actions.  Further, the vote to deny witnesses in the impeachment trial sends a message that the president and his entire staff, is no longer responsible to Congressional oversight. The American people deserve a fair trial and the Senate has a duty to the American people to conduct a fair trial. The vote to deny witnesses and documents is an insult to the American people and a dereliction of the Senate’s duty. Impeachment has victims, and in this case, we the people are a mass casualty.  According to a Quinnipiac January 28th poll, 75% of registered voters want witnesses to testify.  Only voters have the power to save our democracy by voting out the perpetrators of this abdication of senatorial responsibility. With his vote, Jim Risch has once again shown that he does not represent the interests of his constituents, and only serves his master in the oval office. Jim Risch has revealed his loyalties to a corrupt administration, his willingness to subvert justice, his lack of integrity, and his complicity in undermining the fundamental democratic institutions of our republic. Today’s vote is yet another indication that Jim Risch is unfit to serve in the Senate; the people of Idaho and the people of the United States deserve better representation. I need your help to raise my voice across the state. Please take a few minutes and make a donation to my campaign. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/harrisforsenate Thank you for your help and support.",58,40,0,8,2,7,1,9,1226194354241326,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1226194354241326&id=958504471010317

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2020-01-05 18:17:22,"Letter sent to Jim Risch today.   January 5, 2020 US Senator James E. Risch 483 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senator Risch; On December 30, 2019 I received an email from your office titled Risch Delivers Successes for Idaho in 2019. Sorry Senator, you don’t get to give yourself a grade.  Idaho voters will grade you, and their rating will not be the A+ you gave yourself. 1.  Assassinating Qassem Soleimani may have eliminated an evil man, but that begs the question, now what? The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand led to World War I, the assassination of Muammar al-Gaddafi destabilized the Middle East and fomented the Syrian war and regime change in Egypt. Is this the start of another unending war, this time with Iran, fought on Iraqi soil creating outright war between Sunni and Shia?  Will you demand authorization when this escalates into war? Why wasn’t the gang of eight notified – or the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee? Excluding  Democrat leadership from national security events moves us one step closer to an authoritarian government. Oversight, Senator. You are tasked with oversight, not observation.  2. You find nothing wrong with the President seeking aid from a foreign power to help him beat his political rival. By the way, we haven’t forgotten those donations from Syrian-American doctors that came in after you arranged a personal meeting for them with the President. All of this while you are personally being investigated for accepting back- channel donations from Russian oligarchs. 3. Senator, you are wrong. There is a climate crisis and we are just five years away from the tipping point. You voted for the contamination of our rivers and streams. You refuse to work with Congressman Simpson on the lower Snake River issues to save Idaho salmon and steelhead. We have already spent $15 billion to save native fish runs when the only real solution is to take down the lower four dams and take action on reversing climate change while there is still time. 4. Although your funding of border security fell short of the President’s voracious appetite for building a border wall, you voted to take billions of dollars from the defense budget to spend on border wall construction, violating congressional budgetary intent. 5. Speaking of the border wall, I lost all respect for you when I attended a meeting in your office with your aide Rachel Burkett. Senator, you asked this very articulate, intelligent young woman of Japanese heritage, whose family members had been interned in Japanese internment camps during World War II, to justify the separation of immigrant children from their parents and caging them. Just contemplate the horror and irony of that for a minute. You show no outrage about the separation, caging, or deaths of children in ICE custody, none whatsoever, and no forethought on Rachel’s visible anguish at defending your unconscionable position. 6. The conservative myth of deficit reduction. You are speaking of the $10 billion Medicare benefit reductions, of course, not the $3 trillion tax cut given to the richest 1% that has increased deficit borrowing by $1 trillion per year or the increase in military spending to 57% of the federal budget and the cost of caring for veterans to 8% of the budget. Senator, you cut Food Stamps, 1.8% of the budget, while increasing spending on the costs of war to nearly 65% of the budget. 7. You voted twice to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Both times I protested in Washington, DC to stop the repeal process.  We won. 8. The problems facing Idaho dairy farmers cannot be solved by limiting the description of “emulsified fats in water” to cow’s milk. Our farmers need the Raft Valley aquafer recharged and they need the markets they worked years to develop opened back up. They need price supports for small producers, not just for mega producers. DAIRY PRIDE Act is a nice thought, but it is utterly feckless and fails to address the systemic problems that dairy farmers face. 9. Judicial confirmation is not something you should be proud of. You voted to confirm judges deemed unqualified, lazy, arrogant ideologues, lacking legal experience, not to mention those who were opposed by both senators representing their state.   All in all, Senator, you have a lot of work to do to improve your grade. Perhaps being a senator is a full-time job after all, and you should step aside for someone ready and willing to take on the position. Respectfully, Nancy L. Harris Idaho Democratic Candidate for US Senate _______________________________________________ I am working hard to defeat Jim Risch, but I need your help to get from one end of the state to the other.

We are commanded to publicize the miracle and all eight candles burn bright, shining light into the world.  As a Chassidic Jewish woman, watching my kids lighting the menorah and the chance for family togetherness are my favorite things about this holiday. Especially on the eighth night, life feels so bright with the potential for goodness.   This Chanukah has been one of the hardest of my life, with ten anti-Semitic incidents happening in NYC and more around the country in just the last 8 days.  What do you say to your children, who walk around very visibly Jewish every day, to make them feel safe?  Especially when it’s not clear to you that they are.   What I do know is, we cannot let the hate win.  We must come together and fight this hate with light of our own. As with other attacks, I ask that you help fight this hate with mitzvahs (good deeds), bringing more light into the world.  Reach out to your Jewish friends and ask them how they want to be supported, but honor and respect the fact that many in our communities are grieving and many of our events may be private.  On this last night of Chanukah, let’s light up the whole world with the lights of the menorah and let’s not extinguish it tomorrow. Rather, let’s let those lights carry us through a whole year with our continued resolve to work together to shine out the darkness.   #sharethelight #standuptohate Image description: Black and white photograph of several fully lit menorahs.",12,8,0,4,0,0,0,0,1197070037153758,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1197070037153758&id=958504471010317

Exports increased by over 13 percent, to $28.6 billion, between 2016 and 2017, and the plasma market is projected to “grow radiantly,” according to one industry report. The majority goes to wealthy European countries; Germany, for example, buys 15 percent of all U.S. blood exports. China and Japan are also key customers.”This entire article is startling.

"Nancy Harris for US Senate,Mary Mosley,SW Idaho NOW Chapter,Linda Tosti-Lane","Mary Mosley,SW Idaho NOW Chapter,Linda Tosti-Lane",2019-11-14 11:17:32,"The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is now expired and stagnant in the senate, stuck in committee by the NRA due to gun ban extended to boyfriends and stalkers.  VAWA is a vital, highly popular, and successful act.  This press release from the National Organization for Women (NOW) details its complexity in protecting women from domestic violence. I am proud to be one of the founding members of the Southwest Idaho NOW Chapter, we have met regularly with Senator Crapo on this bill and we will be back this morning again. I urge everyone to make this a priority issue and call your senators and demand action on VAWA, women’s lives depend on its protection.Open Letter to Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell, Ashley Parker, and Kristen Welker from the National Organization for Women Political Action Committee November 6, 2019 Ms. Maddow, Ms. Mitchell, Ms. Parker and Ms. Welker: Since June, there have been four Democratic presidential primary debates, with 22 different candidates having participated in at least one debate. The debates spanned six nights total. More than 400 pointed questions were asked of the candidates in these first four debates. The National Organization for Women Political Action Committee (NOW PAC) has analyzed the debates and made the following findings of these 400+ questions: • There was only one question asked to one candidate about LGBTQIA+ rights – even though the Supreme Court is currently hearing historic cases on LGBTQIA+ job protections. • There were 23 questions about navigating race relations but zero touched specifically on the unique issues regarding the federal government’s relations with Native Americans. • There were 41 questions about immigration, but zero were about violence against immigrant women. • There were 14 questions about education, but zero were about sexual assault on campus. • There were zero questions about sexual harassment and the #MeToo era – even though the fourth debate was held on the second anniversary of the #MeToo social media movement. • There were zero questions about disability rights – while one in four Americans live with a disability. • There were zero questions asked about domestic violence – not even during any of the 34 questions about gun control, despite the fact that 52 women each month are shot and killed by an intimate partner. • There were zero questions about child care or universal preschool – even though, on average, families spend 7.8% of their household incomes on these programs. • There were zero questions about paid family leave – even though the United State is the only major country in the United Nations that does not require any paid family leave. The fifth Democratic debate on November 20 will be hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post in Georgia – and for the first time, a debate will be moderated entirely by women. We strongly believe that women are not the only ones responsible for giving a voice to issues that disproportionately affect women (just like moderators of color should not be expected to carry the load on issues like immigration and racial justice). However, we imagine you’ve internally acknowledged that this is an opportunity to show the country what political discourse would look like if women had an equal seat at the table. Below are 12 questions and follow-ups that are not “niche issues” or “identity politics” – they are on the minds of millions of Americans every day and they are waiting for debate moderators to acknowledge them. • As President, what are the concrete steps you will take to not just defend existing access but expand access to sexual and reproductive health care, especially for women of color, low-income women, transgender and gender non-binary folks? • Women in the U.S. are 21 times more likely to be killed with a gun than women in other high-income countries and a domestic abuser’s access to a firearm increases the risk of femicide by 400%. One large problem is in lax enforcement of existing laws. How will you close the loopholes on federal gun laws and better enforce existing laws while addressing the specific needs of victims of gender-based violence? o More broadly, what efforts will you introduce to prevent domestic and sexual violence? • Native American women are more likely to experience violence and sexual violence than any other racial or ethnic group. What would your administration do to tackle this issue and also how would you create trust between tribal, state and federal police on these cases? • What are your plans to achieve full equality under the law for women, women-identifying, gender non-binary, and LGBTQIA+ people in this country? • More than 23 percent of female college students report being subjected to sexual assault. At the same time, the Trump administration has sought to reverse Obama-era policies to prevent sexual assault on campus. What will you do to combat the epidemic of sexual violence on college campuses? • Studies show that women and girls with disabilities are twice as likely to experience gender-based violence compared to women and girls without disabilities. What would your administration do the address this to protect women and girls with disabilities? o What other ways has your campaign focused on how people with disabilities are affected by various policies from housing to jobs to healthcare? • From workplace harassment to family separation, immigrant women are at heightened risk for sexual harassment, assault, and violence. How will you address this in your plans for immigration reform? • The Paycheck Fairness Act, which advances modest steps towards equal pay, has been lingering in Congress for more than two decades. Sex-based pay discrimination costs women and their families hundreds of thousands of dollars over a career. What will you do to assure that a law aimed at reducing sex-based pay discrimination is adopted? • What role can the federal government play in reducing sexual harassment in all workplaces, from Hollywood to farms to homes that employ domestic workers? • The United States is the only major country in the United Nations that does not require any paid family and medical leave. Do you think this should change and if so, describe your proposed paid family leave program? • Do you believe our K-12 system should be expanded to include universal daycare and/or preschool? If so, describe how you would accomplish that? What specific changes could be made to our current funding of programs in the meantime as a short-term solution before implementing universal programs? • Retired women are 80 percent more likely than men to live in poverty after age 65, outliving their partners by five or more years and also outliving their savings. Women are two-thirds of low-wage workers and are more likely to have had part-time work with no pensions. Many women – and men -- rely on Social Security’s modest benefits as their main source of income in retirement. Would you support increasing Social Security benefits for all retirees?  o Women are the main caregivers who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or ill relatives. Would you support a modest Caregiver Credit under Social Security in compensation for time taken out of the paid work force? #AskThemMore  · @NationalNOWPAC · @NBCNews and @WashingtonPost · @maddow @mitchellreports @ashleyrparker @kwelkernbc · @NationalNOWPAC · @NBCNews and @WashingtonPost · @therachelmaddowshow @AndreaMitchellMSNBC @AshleyParkerWaPo @KristenWelkerNBC",21,12,0,0,3,1,5,0,1154233261437436,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1154233261437436&id=958504471010317

[the money] goes where we want it to go . . . ” Clearly Congress appropriated money for missiles to be delivered to Ukraine and the President withheld it for personal political gain.

Hundreds of people around the state worked untold hours to get Medical Expansion passed and into law. Today is humbling and through my tears of joy I am going to share Luke Mayville's morning letter with all of you.  Our job is not over, Risch and all our GOP members of congress, stand ready to repeal the ACA in 2021. Meanwhile, I stand ready to fight to save it.  From Luke Mayville: Dear supporters of Reclaim Idaho and the campaign to expand Medicaid, Yesterday, a Reclaim Idaho volunteer walked into the Health & Welfare office in her North Idaho town.  She learned that there is an employee on staff who spends most of his work hours calling people and informing them that, due to Medicaid Expansion, they are now eligible for health coverage. All day long, the employee can be overheard throughout the building exclaiming “Good news! You’re approved for Medicaid!” He tells his co-workers that nowadays he’s so much happier on the job.  For the past several years, he spent much of his time informing people that—tragically—they fell into a “coverage gap” due to their income and so they were not eligible for healthcare. But now his job has changed. He now gets to inform many of those same people that Medicaid Expansion will cover them.  When the Reclaim Idaho volunteer heard all of this, she burst into tears. She recalled the hundreds of hours she’d spent collecting signatures and organizing her local volunteer team, and suddenly it sunk in that her work had changed the lives of thousands. Today is a big day. For the past several weeks, Health & Welfare officials have been contacting thousands of Idahoans directly and informing them that they are now eligible for Medicaid. But today is the first day of Open Enrollment, when all who are eligible can apply for Medicaid Expansion themselves. For those who enroll, health coverage will begin January 1st. Do you believe that you, a friend, or a family member might be eligible for the expanded Medicaid program? Click here to visit the official Medicaid Expansion webpage, where you can learn whether you are eligible and how to apply for coverage. Please forward this newsletter to anyone you know who may be eligible for expanded Medicaid, or to anyone who may have an eligible friend or family member.I wish to acknowledge two incredible women who were always willing to help whenever the call came, Chris Stroh and Nancy Harris.

Help me keep pushing the Progressive agenda! Press Release: Idaho has three Democratic candidates running for the US Senate, but Nancy Harris was the only one to file a third-quarter financial disclosure report with the Federal Elections Commission on October 15.  According to Harris’s report, her campaign raised $18,204.16, while apparently neither James Vandermaas nor Travis Oler reached the $5,000 mandatory reporting minimum. Current Republican Senator Jim Risch has raised $922,177.09. Harris’s campaign is a grass roots effort. As of September 30, 392 people have made donations to her campaign. This averages out to $34.53 each. She has worked long hours and driven hundreds of miles to get this far. From Coeur d’Alene to Rexburg and beyond, she has gathered hundreds of signatures to get her name on the ballot. Said Harris, “I want signatures from as many counties as I can get, and that takes road work.” Harris made a loan of $1,500 to her campaign.  Harris is the first woman to run for the US Senate in Idaho since Gracie Pfost ran in 1962. Pfost lost the race 49% to 51% to Representative Len Jordan, who had been appointed to fill the seat left vacant when Representative Henry Dworshak died.  https://secure.actblue.com/donate/harrisforsenate Not affiliated with FaceBook",13,11,0,2,0,0,0,0,1133855750141854,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1133855750141854&id=958504471010317

I’ve never heard her refer to President Trump as anything other than “the President” or “Mr. President.” And, by the way, please address her as Madam Speaker or Speaker Pelosi, she earned that title the hard way. Last week was a shameful week for our country. The President unilaterally pulled out of Syria leaving American allies to die on the battle field. His good buddy Erdogan unleashed the hounds of hell on 2 million Kurds and the genocide began. In only a matter of hours, Kurdish leader Hervin Khalar, was dragged from her car and mutilated to death by Erdogan militia, beaten until she no longer had a face, filled with so many bullet holes she had no torso. The internet is filled with pictures of crying children stranded without their parents, children burned from white phosphorus, and rumors abound that napalm has also been used.  Senator, you may hope that the Syrian cease fire strategy “settles down sooner rather than later.” I, for one, hope there is a lot more finger wagging at those responsible for propping up this failed administration.

Turkey has a long history of bloody successes and territorial expansion. Ask the Armenians. Just 100 years ago, between 700,000  and 1.5 million Armenians were marched to their death, while the world turned a blind eye to this genocide. This time, the world will watch as Turkey and Russia begin the wholesale, systematic slaughter of the US’s Kurdish allies. I am particularly mindful of the all-female Kurdish combat units assigned to the Peshmerga Zeravani. Peshmerga, which means ‘Those who face death’, are the women who picked up arms in 2014 and faced death to defeat ISIS. They were deployed to the Basheer front, helped capture and save the Mosul Dam and still guard it, they also helped capture Kirkuk and the nearby oil field facilities at Bai Hassan from ISIS, and now they stand guard over ISIS prisoners. If Erdoğan and Putin think they will march 30 million Kurds to their death, then they have another think coming. Just look at the pictures of the Peshmerga Zeravani. Those women are resolute, combat-hardened soldiers, and they will fight to the death while the US stands by and watches.  If that isn’t enough, remember that over 11,000 Kurds died fighting for the US in Syria and 24 US soldiers died. These are the people the US is abandoning.  Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, Idaho Senator Risch refuses to open a hearing on this outrageous change of policy.  In a statement today, Risch concluded with, “All parties should immediately de-escalate and return to border security discussions.”  Perhaps Risch could encourage Erdoğan to build a fence, I’m sure our president has design ideas available for consideration. I don't know if the Turkish President promised Donald Trump a hotel in Istanbul or dirt on Joe Biden, but the United States’ pullout of Syria is another example of our apprentice President making another decision that is not in the best interests of the United States or our allies. Meanwhile, Senator Risch seems most interested in coddling his party’s President, as he sits idly by while America loses credibility with its allies and the rest of the world.

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2019-10-01 16:29:09,"Yesterday I attended the Northwest Power and Conservation Council’s (NWPCC) Public Hearing on the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program. The NWPCC is under court order to find a way to save Idaho salmon runs or the judge will order the lower four Snake River dams breached to give Idaho’s critically endangered fish full access to their breeding grounds.  This is a complex problem and there are no easy solutions. The only Idaho member of Congress to work tirelessly to save the salmon is Congressman Mike Simpson. When elected to the Senate, I will wholeheartedly join him in his quest to improve fish production, migration and survival. I have included a copy of my testimony at yesterday’s hearing.   NWPCC Hearing on Salmon Recovery Testimony We have been battling the extinction of Idaho salmon since 1980, for nearly 40 years.  We have spent over $15 billion dollars to balance the needs of the salmon survival versus human energy needs. During the past 40 years, humans have won and fish have lost. The Bonneville Power Administration still operates under plans developed forty years ago when hydro-power was the darling electrical generator in a fossil fuel world. However, hydro-power is now behind the times. It is time to breach the four lower Snake River dams and save the salmon. Last weekend I stood on the steps of the Capitol as nearly 2,000 or more students rallied for the climate strike. Their words were powerful, and we must listen to them because they are fearful their own species is about to go extinct. I look at Idaho salmon as the canary in the coal mine. If we don’t do what is necessary to save the salmon, how can we look our grandchildren or great grandchildren in the eye and tell them we did everything we could to save the environment for them? It is time for bold actions. We can find a way to get Idaho grain to port for export; first by rail carrier to Yakima, then by barge to Portland. If we need to convert Lewiston from a seaport to a rail terminal port, it can be done. It is doable and will not cost another $15 billion. Breach the dams, let the fish a freely swim upstream to lay their eggs. It is nothing more than a down payment to future generations. The kids say their house is on fire. It is our responsibility to do everything we can to put that fire out.

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2019-09-26 12:44:40,"For the second time in my life, a President is under a formal impeachment investigation. Of the three Presidents who have been impeached, this is the one that troubles me the most. It troubles me because our junior Senator from Idaho, Jim Risch, seems to believe that it is some sort of Democratic witch-hunt instead of a violation of the President’s oath of office and an impeachable offense. Senator Risch, who has served in a number of government related legal professions in his long career as a professional politician, seems to have missed the class on Constitutional law. Time and again, Senator Risch has had the opportunity to speak out against the President’s illegal and immoral actions, and he has taken none. Not when President Trump refused to release tax returns, nor when he refused to put his company in a blind trust, nor when he lied about his Russian building development plans, nor when it was revealed that Manafort’s millions of Ukrainian payments had been hidden from the federal government, nor when Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails were released through WikiLeaks, nor when the President allegedly obstructed justice. Not once has Senator Risch spoken out against any of these acts. So here we stand nearly three years after the election. For two years we were enmeshed in the Mueller investigation which showed that the President had obstructed the law. For all three years of his presidency, the President has blocked subpoenas, suppressed witnesses, refused to turn over documents, and routinely violated the law. Senator Risch, who has always put his party over the country, has said nothing. These allegations will now fall into the lap of Senator Risch and the Foreign Relations Committee. The appropriate action would be to immediately investigate the President’s attempted use of Ukraine as foreign power to aid in the 2020 election and his blocking Congress’s power to oversee the Executive Branch. I am pleased that there are some Republican Senators who will vote what the evidence shows. Not Jim Risch. It is very doubtful that Senator Risch will initiate an investigation of the abuse of presidential power. He will not stand up for the Constitution nor for the citizens of the United States.

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2019-09-25 19:11:53,"When I was young, before the dams were built on the lower Snake River, I saw the Salmon River teaming with thousands of adult salmon. It was a beautiful river of red and silver, teaming with life, and I have never forgotten it. With salmon now on the brink of extinction--their count this year was in the single digits--the cost of court ordered salmon recovery has reached over $17 billion. Remediation has been so unsuccessful that a judge has finally ordered that plans must now include removing the dams. Breaching dams is a very complex issue that will affect the Bonneville Power Administration, Idaho’s grain shipments for export, and the Port of Lewiston along with other small ports. There will be a need for a rail terminal and farmers’ pumping costs will increase, but there will be renewed fishing habitat in the greater mountain ecosystems and forest health will improve. I firmly believe that we must save these fish. It is a down payment to our grandchildren to save our planet for future generations. Every day the earth warms and water temperatures rise, reducing the chance for salmon recovery. There is no time to waste. We must act now.

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2019-09-06 14:07:52,"Statement on Work Requirements for Medicaid Nancy Harris Boise, Idaho Republicans often quote “The best government is that which governs least.” When Governor Little took office, he signed an executive order to “reduce regulatory burdens on Idahoans” by eliminating two existing rules for every new one. Apparently our Republican Legislature misread the Order and created three regulations when none was needed.  Idaho voters approved a clean Medicaid Expansion by more than 60 percent of the vote. Unable to resist their scorn and judgement, the Legislature passed burdensome work requirements which will vastly increase government bureaucracy and unnecessary spending.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, most people on Medicaid (63 percent) are already working at paid jobs; they just don’t make enough money to buy private insurance. The vast majority (approximately 90 percent) of those who don’t work for pay are disabled or ill, or are caring for someone else who is disabled or ill, or in school, or impoverished elderly.  Recipients of Medicaid typically work in agriculture, construction, leisure and hospitality industries, jobs which may be seasonal and have irregular, unpredictable hours, making it difficult for the workers to fulfill a certain number of work hours per week. I personally feel a broader time frame that takes into consideration the irregular hours of work would be more equitable. The Department of Employment should have industry predictable averages available for legislative decision making in order make requirements more humane, equitable and predicable for cash flow management.  It is my belief work requirements have nothing to do with good governmental management. If it did, the requirements would require the least regulations possible. But these regulations are for the sole purpose to establish legal precedent, and to conjoin Idaho’s case law with other work requirement states and then appeal to the Supreme Court for the purpose of overturning the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Lobbyist in the medical and pharmaceutical industries feed the Republican Party vast donations, we must not discount their influence in any regulation concerning the ACA. Idaho Republicans have clearly expressed their disdain for the Idaho working poor.  If they are poor they do not deserve a higher minimum wage, affordable healthcare or a good education. Surely, God wanted the poor to be poor, otherwise he would have made them rich. We do not need restrictions designed primarily to punish people with low incomes for their poverty. That is not the Idaho my great grandparents homesteaded, it is not “The Idaho Way.” We can and must do better.",34,27,0,7,0,0,0,3,1096556053871824,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1096556053871824&id=958504471010317
"Nancy Harris for US Senate,Valarie Kaur",Valarie Kaur,2019-09-05 22:25:08,"There are times when another person's story tells the truth in our hearts. I am shocked at how easily we have transgressed from an open accepting country to one filled with vile hatefulness spewing from the mouths of normal appearing adults.  This cannot be the new normal in our society. I lived in Spain for four years, 1969-1974, my husband at the time was in the Air Force. Everywhere we went we were easily identified by our clothes, our mannerisms and my horrible Spanish accent. Even our car had a licences plate number that identified us as American.   Americans were generally hated by Europeans who chaffed under the bit of residual Marshall Plan restraints.  However, we never experienced the rude, abhorrent behavior spewing out of the mouths of people today.  This must stop, we are better people than this. Let's listen to the wisdom of a four year old. Just breathe and push. Inhale and push back.  Don't be a face in the crowd, take a big breath and surround the victim and push back.  You'll be glad you did and so will our brothers and sisters of color.On Saturday night, my parents took my four-year old to a summer concert in a park by the water. On the way home, Kavi was riding on his grandfather’s shoulders, on top of the world. He wanted to take the water taxi across the marina. They were waiting on the dock when they heard an irate voice. ""I've been living here for seven years, and I know the schedule!” A white woman was yelling at a boat conductor. The boats were waiting to ferry all the families leaving the concert at the same time. “You need to get me a boat right now!"" The woman started to swear. My father, ever cheerful, ever trying to be helpful, said to the woman: ""He's just trying to do his job. But listen, you can walk this way around the Marina and get where you want to be in fifteen minutes..."" ""Mind your own fucking business,"" she said. My father told her not to use that language around Kavi. The woman began yelling at my father. My mother put her body between them. Kavi squeezed my father’s head. My father gripped Kavi's legs and walked away fast, but the woman followed them down the dock and yelled --  ""Go back to the country you came from!"" She said it effortlessly, as if it was just in the air. She had only to reach out and grab hold of it and aim it at my father and son. My parents came home shaken. ""What happened to the woman?"" I asked them. They ferried her across the water -- by herself. She got what she wanted.  I imagined what would have happened had this person been a black man, or a brown bearded man like my father. Handcuffed. Maybe shot. But here was a white person who acted hateful and entitled – and was rewarded. It was a picture of white privilege. It was also a painful picture: She was on the boat alone. Isn't that the work of white supremacy? To sever people from community and connection in exchange for the illusion of security. ""Didn’t anyone speak up?"" I asked. “No one said anything,"" my mom said, more upset by the bystanders than the assailant. There was a small crowd of about fifteen people watching. A few offered sympathies after the fact, but no one did anything while it happened. Just like last time, when my father was walking on the beach with my son, wearing a baby carrier, and a man called him “suicide bomber.” And the time before that, when I confronted a man shouting “sand-nigger” in our neighborhood restaurant. Each time, there were bystanders who did nothing.  That night, while putting Kavi to sleep, I tried to help him process what happened.  ""I feel sad,"" he said. I kissed him and stroked his forehead and we talked about where we feel sadness in our bodies. Then we sang a shabad, a prayer, and he started to fall asleep. I lie there, with my eyes open. How could people be so casually cruel in front of a four-year old? Then I remembered – This is a time with the government is separating small brown children who look like my son from their parents, caging them indefinitely, letting them die in custody or in the desert. This is a time when white supremacists are massacring brown families and their children in houses of worship. This is a time when “Go back to your country” is mouthed by the President of the United States, scrawled on the walls of our temples, and heard on the lips of those white supremacists before they open fire. This is a time when each day brings reports of all varieties of cruelty to brown children. So, of course, why would this person constrain her hate in front of a small brown child?  Suddenly Kavi put his ear on my mouth. ""Mommy, I don't hear you breathing. You have to breathe to sleep."" I thought I was playing it cool. I thought he had fallen asleep. But he sensed my heart pounding, my mind racing, the panic seizing me.  ""You're right, Kavi."" I started to breathe deeply, audibly. A few minutes went by, and my mind started racing again.  ""What happened to 'Breathe and Push,' Mommy?"" All this time, I thought Kavi had no idea about my work in the world. Now here was my four-year old, giving my tools back to me. “Right,” I said.  I started breathing again, and this time breath anchored my body, and my son kept whispering. “Breathe and push, Mommy, just breathe and push.” *** Maybe we are all the people on the dock, trying to get home safely. We have all been in the position of bystanders, watching horrors take place before our eyes. Sometimes on the street. Sometimes by the state. Sometimes in our own families. We want to do something about it, but don’t know what to do. In a climate where people are primed to hate, how do we prime the rest of us to show up, stand up, and speak up when it matters?  I am learning what black and brown mothers on this soil have long known. We cannot protect our children from white supremacist violence — we can only make them resilient enough to face it. And insist, until our dying breath, that there be no more bystanders.

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2019-08-25 17:49:57,"Last Sunday was the 99th anniversary of ratification of the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote. You can help Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) build on this monumental past achievement in two ways: First, wouldn't it be great to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) by this time next year? Currently, 37 of the required 38 states have already voted to ratify the ERA. Resolutions already introduced in both houses of Congress would remove the arbitrary ratification deadline. Sign up to make automatic monthly gifts to help PDA gain support for H.J.Res. 38 and S.Res. 6—legislation that will remove the deadline from the ERA. Second, make 2020 a historic progressive landslide by helping PDA turn out Progressive Democratic voters by joining our amazing current Sustainers by becoming a Sustainer at $19/month to honor the 19th amendment. (We welcome and appreciate gifts of any size). If you’re already a Sustainer, we thank you!  Winning the right to vote for women 99 years ago culminated a long, arduous, and sometimes dangerous struggle. Ratifying the ERA would appropriately celebrate the centennial of Women’s Suffrage by protecting women’s equality under law in the U.S. Constitution. That landmark and winning the White House are both achievable goals for 2020, but only if we all work together and pitch in now! Every analysis of the 2018 and 2020 election cycles indicates that women are key to victory in November 2020. Women of color, suburban women, and young women voted in droves in the midterms last November, leading the way to Democratic victories in the House of Representatives.

It is a call for Idaho's MOC to update their non-responses to the latest mass shootings. Since they are unable and unwilling to respond, I will take the lead and show them how it is done.   We the people of the United States have lost our First Amendment right for peaceable assembly due to the fear of mass shootings.  We are outraged that just any person can walk into a gun store and come out with a military grade weapon, sling it over their shoulder, and sash-shay down the street, or into a school, or church, or synagogue, or shopping mall like they are God's gift to national security.  The only thing I see is someone with the ability to kill dozens of innocent people. As a candidate for Senate, I take the pledge to fight for universal background checks, gun registration, stronger law enforcement, mandatory liability insurance, and removal of semiautomatic weapons from our country.

"Nancy Harris for US Senate,Betty Hansen Richardson",Betty Hansen Richardson,2019-08-17 13:50:59,"I stand for my principles and my values and my hard work, and I value yours equally.  But none of that matters, unless we defeat Jim Risch.  He will go to any length, dig the deepest hole to keep the corptocracy in power.  #RetireRisch https://nancyharrisforsenate.com/ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/harrisforsenateRisch Redux On May 6, 2013, then Statesman political columnist Dan Popkey published an interesting piece recounting his interview with Idaho's junior senator Jim Risch.  Risch was approaching the end of his first term in the U.S. Senate and waxed not-so-eloquently about  the perks of office.   Now that Mr. Risch has announced he is seeking a third term, it's well worth revisiting this piece.  From my perspective, not a lot has changed.  Risch is still living high on the hog while essentially retired on the public dime: Resigned to its dysfunction, Risch loves the Senate By DAN POPKEY — Idaho Statesman Idaho Sen. Jim Risch celebrated his 70th birthday Friday, content in his likely re-election in 2014 to another six years where he can fine-tune his expertise on the Middle East and North Africa. “You know, I really enjoy this job. I really like this job,” Risch said last week, saying it’s a breeze compared to the seven months he served as governor in 2006. “Governor will wear you down. You can’t do that job permanently. This you can do ad infinitum.” Home for a Senate recess that included a visit with the Statesman editorial board, Risch was remarkably passive about the failure of Congress to deal with the country’s problems, starting with a $16 trillion debt. “I can’t explain to you how dysfunctional it is back there,” Risch said, predicting it will take a catastrophe for the national legislature to tackle its responsibilities. “They’re really not bad when it comes to crisis. If there’s a war, if there’s, you know, like the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, those kinds of crises seem to bring people together.” Rather than stick his neck out like his Idaho GOP colleagues — Sen. Mike Crapo and Reps. Mike Simpson and Raul Labrador — Risch has avoided leadership on the debt crisis or immigration. The biggest splash of his four-plus years came last month, when he was the voice of Republicans vowing a filibuster aimed at stalling votes on gun legislation, a sure-fire base builder for re-election. Risch also is proud of employing a temporary block of President Barack Obama’s nomination of Sally Jewell as Interior secretary. The tactic was meant to persuade the administration to embrace Gov. Butch Otter’s plan to keep sage grouse off the endangered species list. “If you’ve got a low tolerance for frustration with the governing process this isn’t the job for you,” Risch said. “You’ve got to learn to do the best you can, get what you can and move on.” Risch touts his role as the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs, which tracks North Africa and the Middle East. That’s meant a lot of overseas trips for the senator and his staff. On Syria, he says, “the president does not have good options,” because supporting the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar Assad will mean “you’re going to be having to sidle up to al-Qaida and some others that are not-so-savory characters.” The last Idaho senator to take such an interest in foreign affairs was Democrat Frank Church, who chaired the full committee and led the passage of the Panama Canal treaty. Church, after 24 years, was defeated in 1980 in significant part because Idahoans thought he’d caught “Potomac fever” and lost touch with Idaho. Risch’s conservative voting may inoculate him from such a malady. But to hear him wax eloquent about life in the Senate makes one wonder if he risks being branded as a dilettante. With his wife, Vicki, at his side, Risch boasted about her membership on the board of Ford’s Theater, where the couple entertain themselves “relatively frequently.” Last year, Mrs. Risch chaired the luncheon for Michelle Obama, organized by Senate spouses. Their condo is on Pennsylvania Avenue, Risch said, allowing the pleasure of spectating at various misguided protests. Despite the failure of the Senate to agree on matters vital to the nation’s future, everybody gets along just swell, Risch reports. “You hear about this toxic atmosphere,” he said, but it’s not like that when senators and their spouses get together. “We talk about our kids, we talk about sports. … Socially, the people are incredibly, incredibly civil to each other.” Risch brushes off criticism the Senate takes too much time off from Washington. “There’s nothing happening when we’re back there and there’s nothing happening when we’re not back there. What’s the difference?” He chortles at the toothless threats of Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to make the Senate work weekends. Said Risch, who spent about two decades as a leader in the Idaho Senate: “Can you imagine if I would have stood up on the floor as the majority leader and said, ‘We’re going to work this Saturday’ and then not do it?” Risch is nostalgic about his 22 years in the state Senate, 5 1/2 years as lieutenant governor and brief stint as governor. He wishes he could click his heels and transport 105 Idaho lawmakers to Washington. “Put them in charge and they’d straighten this thing out in a couple few months,” he said. “They’ve got common sense. They can understand these things and they actually do stuff.” What I find odd about Risch’s blithe spirit is how easily he’s adapted after a lifetime of making things happen. “When you wake up in the morning and you’re governor they hand you a plate and it’s pretty full and they say, ‘Eat this.’ And you’ve got to eat what’s on the plate. “That’s one of the differences with this job. You can do a lot more of what you want to do. There’s 100 senators, 435 congressmen; we all have our own ideas, our own passions in life. We all have our own interests and you can pursue them.”",27,22,0,0,3,0,2,3,1083240755203354,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1083240755203354&id=958504471010317

Nancy Harris for US Senate,,2019-08-14 11:19:03,"Much has transpired since this article was published back during May, but I say this in a positive way! EXCERPT: Thus far, the only declared opponent against Risch is businesswoman Nancy Harris. Taking a look at Nancy’s campaign page, one can see that she has some very strong leftist values and I hope she gets the nominee. Some may say she will have a hard time winning in a state as red as Idaho, but we could very well see something at least similar to Stacy Abrams and Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 campaigns that will open the door for more progressive challengers in the future even if she does lose. The highest profile contender seems to be Idaho’s 2014 Democratic Gubernatorial nominee, A.J. Balukoff. Considering that he lost that election with 38.6% of the vote and that he doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page, this is not very reassuring. On the other hand, 2014 is cited as a terrible year for democrats so maybe he has a better shot given the significant leftward shift the US electorate has had. Other potential candidates include State Senator Mark Nye and Idaho Senate Minority Leader Michelle Stennett. The up side is that there has been increased turnout among left leaning voters in Idaho in 2018, and that this might continue into 2020. Unfortunately this means there will need to be a lot of them if there is any hope of dethroning Jim Risch. This just makes it all the more important that any Democrats in Idaho get out to vote for whoever runs against him in 2020. If there is no changes to the political climate of Idaho, than we can most likely expect 367,993 people to vote Republican and 207,303 to vote Democrat. https://guardianacorn.com/2019/05/25/pink-tsunami-the-2020-senatorial-elections-part-two/",20,14,1,4,1,0,0,0,1081200255407404,NancyHarrisforSenate,/story.php?story_fbid=1081200255407404&id=958504471010317
