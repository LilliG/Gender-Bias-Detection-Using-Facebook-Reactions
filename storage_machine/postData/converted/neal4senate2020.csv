Glen Neal for United States Senate,,2020-04-11 01:55:46,"I agree with the Covid-19 government guidelines administered by the CDC and President Trump. I have been practicing the guidelines from the time of their release. Recently Governor Lee has proclaimed his own statewide mandates to be followed which goes considerably farther than the national guidelines. I can foresee Constitutional conflicts with the state mandates and expect them to be pointed to in the near future and challenged as to their legality. Our nation has many freedoms and rights that are guaranteed and should not be suppressed by any administrative order or legislated law. Our elected officials should never intentionally violate the rights and freedoms of the citizens of our great Republic As an American Patriot, If you have concerns of this presently occurring sound out and let your objections be heard. The future of the United States of America may be in jeopardy if we fail to act.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1103102076721833,neal4senate2020,/story.php?story_fbid=1103102076721833&id=846912302340813

Glen Neal for United States Senate,,2020-04-23 09:59:49,"China has created a worldwide panic by setting the Covid-19 virus loose with no attempt on the part of the Chinese to share any information about this disease. Now it is being reported that they may have developed a vaccine that will be available as early as August 2020. This whole Covid-19 pandemic stinks like a dead rat.  Our next big government expenditure should be on our infrastructure and a significant portion of the money should be earmarked for developing an industrial base to bring all manufacturing back home from China. The Communist Government of China must be punished economically for the damage they have done to our economy.  To accomplish becoming independent from China Americans must make drastic changes in the makeup of congress. The Rhinos absolutely must go and be replaced with individuals that care more about our nation and it's people than they care about making themselves and their buddies rich. There will be no place for partisan politics in the next congress. That would definitely require a change to Republicans becoming the majority party and Nancy Pelosi and her socialist followers sent back to hide in the basement of the Capital Building to continue their anti American scheming. I would like to share with you what a former member of Congress recently said about China and the Covid-19 virus: From Trey Gowdy: I'm not saying Covid-19 isn't real... But Pay attention folks, there's much more going on here than what meets the eye. Is it a coincidence that just when the economy is booming, the stock market is setting record highs, we are winning the trade wars, school shootings have stopped, our nation is at peace, the Democratic party is a disaster and so is their likely nominee(Biden).  He hasn't a chance in hell & they're not about to let an outsider(Bernie) destroy their scheme. It looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment, then all the sudden world crisis pandemic. Stock market tumbles, companies are laying off employees, everything is closed and canceled, CEO's of giant companies are resigning and indictments are coming. Now they say there are a couple ways a President doesn't win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy. But there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it(Corona virus)originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump. Let's not forget Biden's back door deals with CHINA as well. China doesn't want 4 more years of Trump either. It all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election. Couldn't have hit at a more perfect time. With the Democrats running out of campaign talking points in light of no school shootings, no migrant caravans at the southern border, fighting in Syria winding down, North Korea not firing missiles and Trump beating a sham impeachment. The corona virus gave them one last hail Mary to try and point fingers at Trump with the clock winding down in 2020. This is almost the perfect fascist playbook. Control the population with fear-mongering and panic, control the media, spread propaganda and the fan-favorite disarm the population. Oh, and did anyone notice that while they are mad as hell at Trump for not sending aid to Ukraine, they THEMSELVES voted AGAINST giving ANY emergency aid to all Americans ? Sorry but I don't think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all, and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten. The common flu has killed more people this year already and the media is SILENT! A handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake. It all just seems fishy, a little too well-timed if you ask me.",2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1113023142396393,neal4senate2020,/story.php?story_fbid=1113023142396393&id=846912302340813

Glen Neal for United States Senate,,2020-02-15 05:27:24,"Senator Lamar Alexander betrays his constituents again! Senator Alexander found himself not supporting President Trump again which also means he has betrayed the people of Tennessee. Having not supported his party and president  on numerous occasions his actions have become more bizarre as time passes.  I find it hard to believe that voters were fooled into electing him to the Senate on three separate occasions and he will be expecting voters to send a person he endorses to succeed him.  In the upcoming Republican Primary the only issue for voters will be in who can you place your trust, because all true Republicans should be supporters of the RNC's party platform.  So do you go with the politician William Hagerty IV or the newcomer to Tennessee and politics Dr. Manish Sethi or do you choose me, Glen Neal, a non-political person who holds only the desire to properly represent the good people of Tennessee.  I am a honest person with integrity and hold a belief that the lives of all Tennesseans matter.  I am the only candidate that refuses to be bought by big money being put in the treasures of the others by corporations, special interest groups and wealthy supporters.  Don't let yourself be fooled by the smoke and mirror tactics of millionaire candidates that will never live up to your expectations.   I am from Tennessee, live solely in Tennessee and love Tennessee and it's people.  I have a true Tennessee heritage as I am Member of the First Families of Tennessee.  I am educated in Tennessee schools and worked as a public servant in Tennessee until my retirement from the Knox County Sheriff's Office.  I am a Christian and son of parents that were hard working blue collar members of society.  I am a proud Tennessean and a true American Patriot.   I will work endlessly to bring about term limits and campaign finance reforms that will put Congress back in the hands of the people of America and out of the hands of the criminals that occupy it now.   I seek no wealth or fame.  I intend to accept only the pay I earn and only the acknowledgement of having properly represented my constituents as they have willed.  Leaving the Senate at the same financial status and reputation to that which I entered.

The caller asked a very important detailed question that required an in depth answer that prompted another question from the caller. An hour and forty minutes later and many more questions and answers the caller invited me to come and address a group that he is involved with and share the contents of our conversation to his group, in addition he told me that I would have his support and vote.  I very much appreciate him and have scheduled a meeting date with his group.

Glen Neal for United States Senate,,2020-02-08 15:46:40,"Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate are making their way around the state stumping their political views. I have noticed the majority of questions asked consist of, ""what are you for"", and each candidate will respond with two or three of their chosen talking points tailored to the who they stand before. Makes one think that they are good Republicans and and stand for the party and President Trump, but we have been shown that it want hold water as they like Senator Alexander are likely not to support the positions of their constituents. I on the other hand will tell you that I follow the platform of the Republican National Committee and President Donald J. Trump. A better question to ask the candidates is, ""what part of the RNC's platform do you disagree with and do you support the President's vision for the nation"" and what guarantees do you offer that you will keep your word. To show Tennesseans that I will support both in their entirety I, Glen Neal, will sign a contract with the people of Tennessee as proof. If a Republican candidate is not willing to do the same the are not a true Republican as several sitting Senators have demonstrated. Ask Dr. Manish Sethi, William Hagerty IV and the other candidates if they will sign a contract with the people. Furthermore, ask each how many terms do they intend to serve if elected. I will give you my answer now, ONE or maybe TWO if an overwhelming amount of Tennesseans indicate they want me to return, but under no circumstances THREE and I will make it part of my contract with the people. Now ask yourself, do you want a Senator that is educated in the most liberal University in America, Harvard, lives a lifestyle that is outside the mainstream of most Tennesseans, made their fortunes off of hardworking people, has a predetermined agenda showing favoritism to high dollar contributors and throwing crumbs to the common people. Don't let yourself be taken in by the soundbites designed and propagandize their path too a seat in the Senate that does not include you. I on the other hand was born to blue collar working class parents, educated in state schools and worked at public servant as a Deputy Sheriff of Knox County, Tennessee. Living my entire life in and among the people of Tennessee. I, like most Tennesseans have known what it is like to live from paycheck to paycheck and sometimes working at several jobs. I have been challenged by the high cost of health care, high taxes and unforeseen emergencies of many kinds. Unlike other candidates I have felt your pain and remain sympathetic to everyone caught up in this situation. No Tennesseans should suffer the indignity of not having enough money for housing, food, clothing, transportation, health care, prescription drugs and other necessities of life. Government exists to solve problems of the people and not create them. Ask yourself how many things in your life has government improved for you and what other things can government do to improve your life. Now compare that to what government has done for corporations, special interest groups and wealthy Tennesseans. I'll bet the latter comes out on top. I owe no allegiance to any other than the people of Tennessee. I have not accepted any campaign contribution of more than $100 and have rejected any and all contributions with conditions unlike other candidates I can not be bought. I promise to work solely for the people of Tennessee. I am a proud seventh generation Tennessean and tenth generation American coming from humble beginning and becoming a candidate for the United States Senate hoping to represent the people of Tennessee from which I come.

Glen Neal for United States Senate,,2019-09-13 13:41:53,"It is an absolute travesty that our partisan political leaders have let the Republic of China take control of so many things that are essential to our everyday life. China has taken control of our pharmaceutical supply needed for health care and the rare earth metals necessary for most advanced electronics just to name a few. If China decided to make it difficult on our people and country it would throw both into catastrophic turmoil that would take decades of hardship to recover to normality. U.S. citizens have for years watched their jobs disappear overseas and at home to illegal aliens while politicians played politics instead of stepping up to protect their constituents from the critical issues for which they were elected. When elected to the Senate I will work diligently to change these injustices. President Trump is the first President in decades that has taken on nations of the world that are taking huge advantages of the U.S. in our ridiculous deficit trade policies that place us at a disadvantage. His leadership has set us on a course of equality in trade. We can no longer afford to keep letting billions of dollars leave the U.S. never to return. The politicians in Washington have idly stood by and allowed this devastation of our nation to transpire must be replaced with loyal patriotic servants of the people that will put the people's business before that of big business, corporations, lobbyists, wealthy contributors and special interest groups. Furthermore, new want-a-be politicians seeking office and cut from the same cloth as their predecessors should be shunned for their lack of caring for the people they seek to thoughtlessly represent. I have walked the same paths as you and I can better relate to you than the others seeking the job. Do not let us fall further into the grasps of nations like the Republic of China. Take a stand and choose a Senate candidate that puts your interests first and will work tirelessly to bring government back to the people by supporting campaign finance reform, term limits, the rule of law, border security, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, fixing the Health Care dilemma, improving veteran benefits, rebuilding our infrastructure and more.

Glen Neal for United States Senate,,2019-09-01 11:42:06,"A continuously growing population of illegal aliens, along with the federal government’s ineffective efforts to secure our borders, present overwhelming national security and public safety threats to the United States.  They also have a severely negative impact on the nation’s taxpayers at the local, state, and national levels. Illegal immigration costs U.S. Citizens billions of dollars each year.  ""Illegal aliens"" are net users of taxpayer funded benefits and the limited taxes paid by some segments of the illegal alien population in no way offset the growing financial burdens imposed on U.S. taxpayers by massive numbers of uninvited recipients.  The fiscal impact of ""illegal aliens"" are echoed  in both federal and state budgets.   Estimating the fiscal burden of illegal immigration on the U.S. taxpayer depends on the size and characteristics of the ""illegal alien"" population.   A definition of  “illegal alien” is anyone who entered the United States without authorization and anyone who unlawfully remains once his/her authorization has expired.  Regrettably, the U.S. government has databases containing information on the citizenship status of everyone lawfully present in the United States, but not the unlawful.  The overall problem of estimating the ""Illegal alien"" population is further complicated by the fact that the majority of available sources on immigration status rely on self-reported data.  Given that ""illegal aliens"" have a motive to be untruthful about their immigration status, in order to avoid discovery, the accuracy of these statistics is doubtful, at best.  All of the preceding issues make it very difficult to assess the current illegal alien population of the United States. However, it is now estimated that there are approximately 22.5 million “illegal alien” inhabitants.  This number uses previous estimates but adjusts for suspected changes in levels of unlawful migration, based on information provided by the Department of Homeland Security, data available from other federal and state government agencies, and research studies completed by reliable think tanks, universities, and other research organizations. The Federal government spends an estimated net amount of $121 billion dollars on “illegal aliens” and their U.S. born children.  This amount includes expenditures for public education, medical care, justice enforcement initiatives, welfare programs and other miscellaneous costs.  It also factors in the dismal amount “illegal aliens” pay to the federal government in income, social security, Medicare and excise taxes. The approximately $121 billion dollars in federal expenditures attributable to ""illegal aliens"" is staggering, assuming an estimated “illegal alien” population of approximately 22.5 million “illegal aliens” and an estimated 4.3 million U.S. born children of “illegal aliens”, that amounts to roughly $5,492 per “illegal alien”, each year.  For the sake of comparison, the average U.S. college student receives only $4,800 in federal student loans each year. I believe that every concerned American citizen should be asking our government why in a time of increasing costs and shrinking resources is it spending such large amounts of money on individuals who have no right, nor authorization to be in the United States.  This is an especially important question in view of the fact that the “illegal alien” beneficiaries of American taxpayer aid offset very little of the enormous costs of their presence by the payment of taxes. Meantime, average U.S. citizens  pay approximately 30% of their income in taxes. It is believed that most studies overestimate both the taxes actually collected from “illegal aliens” and, more importantly, the amount of taxes actually paid by “illegal aliens” (i.e., the amount of money collected from “illegal aliens” and actually kept by the federal government). This belief is based on a number of factors: Since the 1990’s, the United States has focused on apprehending and removing criminal aliens. The majority of “illegal aliens” seeking employment in the United States have lived in an environment where they have little fear of deportation, even if discovered. This has created an environment where most “illegal aliens” are both able and willing to file tax returns, as a result the vast majority of “illegal aliens” hold low-paying jobs, those who are subject to wage deductions actually end up receiving a complete refund of all taxes paid, plus net payments made on the basis of tax credits. As a result, “illegal aliens” actually profit from filing a tax return and, therefore, have a strong interest in doing so. Even though the costs of illegal immigration borne by taxpayers at the federal level are staggering, they only pale in comparison to the fiscal burden shouldered by taxpayers at the state level.  Most government taxes and fees remitted to government by U.S. citizens are paid in forms other than income taxes submitted to the IRS on tax day. There are city and state income taxes, fuel surcharges, sales and property taxes, etc…. States and localities also bear the main burden for costs associated with public education, city and county infrastructure, and local courts and jails. One further complication is the fact that, while barred from many federal benefits state laws allow “illegal aliens” to access many state funded social welfare programs.  Very little data is collected on the immigration status of individuals collecting benefits it is difficult to determine the rate at which illegal aliens use welfare programs.  However, based on the average income of “illegal alien” households it appears they use these programs at a rate higher than lawfully present aliens or citizens. The combined total of state and local government general expenditures on “illegal aliens” is $71.2 billion dollars.  The services referenced in this category are supported directly by the payment of city, county and state taxes and related fees.  Examples of general expenditures would be the costs of general governance, fire departments, garbage collection, street cleaning and maintenance, etc. The state, county or municipality, or even a special taxing district in some situations may provide some of these services.  In most cases, localities offer more services than the state. By most estimates, there is approximately a  60 percent to 40 percent cost share between local and state governments. The estimate of general expenditure services received by “illegal alien” households, apart from the specific outlays previously mentioned, excludes capital expenditures and debt servicing.  The calculation for each state is based on the state’s annual operating budget, reduced by the amount covered by the federal government. That expenditure is then reduced further based on the relative size of the estimated population of “illegal aliens” and their U.S. born minor children.   As stated in our population estimate, this means states like California, Texas, Florida, New York, with larger “illegal alien” disciples, will bear larger shares of these costs. Offsetting the fiscal costs of the “illegal alien” population are the taxes collected from them at the state and local level.  Many proponents of illegal immigration argue that the taxes paid to the states render “illegal aliens” a net windfall to state and local economies.  Moreover, this is a bogus argument.  Evidence shows that the tax payments made by ""illegal aliens"" fail to cover the costs of the most services they consume. “Illegal aliens” are not typical taxpayers.  First, as previously noted in this study, the large percentage of “illegal aliens” who work in the underground economy frequently avoid paying any income tax at all. Many actually receive a net cash profit through refundable tax credit programs..  Additionally, as previously acclaimed the average earnings of “illegal alien” households are considerably lower than both legal aliens and native born workers. The obvious remedy to this ongoing national emergency is to elect Senators and Congressmen that will promptly and properly address the issue of ""illegal aliens"".   Immigration laws must be changed and enforced without fail.  The proposed physical barrier must be completed and the necessary security personnel and security devices be funded and placed.   As Tennessee's next Senator, I will work diligently to resolve this critical national issue. I am a descendant of a first families of Tennessee and the United States of America and hold a firm belief that our Republic depends on the rule of law to remain a sovereign and strong for all legal citizens.  Let us not be consumed by mediocrity forced on us by our government failing to take appropriate actions in the resolution of illegal immigration. Support and vote for Glen Neal to be Tennessee's next United States Senator.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,917178725314170,neal4senate2020,/story.php?story_fbid=917178725314170&id=846912302340813

I am a common Tennessean with a commonality with most citizens of this great state, because I have walked among you my entire life..
