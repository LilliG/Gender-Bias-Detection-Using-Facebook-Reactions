"Kacey Morgan for U.S. Senate - Tennessee,Lindsey Glenn Krinks",,2020-03-04 13:29:27,"Here's one of #Nashvilletornado stories no one is talking about: These two tall-and-skinny gentrifying death traps were built next door to us in North Nashville. A family used to rent here, but the house was bought, sold, and developed. Each tall and skinny was going for around $365,000. Thank God no one had moved in... as you can see, the construction is shoddy. The entire structure moved from its foundation and the first level completed flattened. It would have crushed anyone inside. We are incredibly concerned about how the tornado damage in North Nashville will open up the neighborhood to even more displacement, gentrification, and death traps like these. We saw a rampant shift in homeownership after the 2010 flood: Renters, lower-income families, and folks who are elderly and or disabled had a very difficult time rebuilding and private equity corporations and developers swooped in, bought up the homes (often short-selling the owners), and flipped the properties. This has a disproportionate effect on black and brown communities.  Nashville, we need land trusts, affordable housing developers, and more financial support to keep these units of housing affordable and to support these families. We have to keep this on the radar, we have to keep working towards solutions. In the meantime, please support our neighbors and friends in North Nashville. Please donate to + volunteer with our comrades at Gideon's Army. They are posting updates and needs from their page (please follow them!).  Open Table Nashville, Inc. will also be posting more updates on how to help our friends on the streets during this time. We know we need tents, tarps, and sleeping bags. All questions and support can be directed to info@opentablenashville.org. Also, our deepest thanks to everyone who has reached out to us and supported us, our neighbors, and our friends on the streets. Andrew Krinks and I have a long way to go, but are safe and supported.
