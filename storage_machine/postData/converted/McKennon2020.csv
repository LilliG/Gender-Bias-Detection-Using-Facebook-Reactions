McKennon For US Senate 2020,,2019-10-18 02:45:59,"Looking at this chart is really depressing.  It is unacceptable.  When Kerry and I talked about running for this office, I told him I would only do it if he was willing to break records and set new precedents for this.  He agreed. When I decided to take the role of Campaign Manager, I promised I would use my skill-set to give us the most historic third-party US Senate performance in the history of Texas.  I truly believe with everything in my heart and soul that we can do this.  However, we cannot do it alone.  We need your financial support, and we need your help in promoting our page all across your friends on social media.  I cannot express how excited I am to be leading this campaign, and I am asking for your help to ensure we branch out across the state of Texas. Please invite all of your friends on your facebook to LIKE our page, and please share our page on your status.  Also, if you would also like to post videos of yourself on facebook endorsing Kerry for your support in our campaign for US Senate, that would be greatly appreciated.   Lastly, like I mentioned above, I need you to take a leap of faith and please contribute any amount to our campaign by going onto www.mckennon2020.com.   I promise you Texas, we will make this the most historic third-party US Senate campaign in our state's history.  All I ask if for your support, if you can give us that, I ensure you come November when the results come in, you will not be disappointed.

McKennon For US Senate 2020,,2019-10-09 00:04:55,"Just earlier today, Kerry and Walter were out to dinner, and a lady came up to them. This woman was from San Antonio, and recognized Kerry as someone who ran for Lt. Governor last year. This lady was not part of our party, and she was visiting friends in Lubbock, and chose to come say hi to Kerry. They talked for several minutes, Kerry mentioned to her he would be running for the US Senate, and she said that was refreshing and exciting news.  Isn’t this incredible?! Someone who Kerry has never met, came up to him, recognized him from running last year as Lt. Governor. This lady was not a Libertarian/member of the party, but was excited to hear that Kerry would be running for the US Senate. Paraphrasing, she said Kerry might be able to do what Beto couldn’t. This is the type of outspoken, personable, and friendly Libertarian that we want running  for our local and state-wide offices, because even non-libertarians are moved and remember Kerry.   This is why it is so important for us to not just raise the filing fee as soon possible, but to make sure that we fundraise for Kerry to be out there, meeting and greeting other Texans representing the face of the party. This just proves Kerry’s point: You are not powerless. This one individual who chose to vote Libertarian, was because she met Kerry and the Libertarian message resonated with her. We hope that she will reach out to those in Bexar County, and we know that Bexar County would love to see Kerry back in San Antonio, here’s how you make that happen; https://secure.anedot.com/mft/slug.",38,26,0,12,0,0,0,0,1964932036876590,McKennon2020,/story.php?story_fbid=1964932036876590&id=521934044509737

Kerry and I are working really hard to make sure that we get this money as soon as possible.  As you all know it can get pretty icy here in the panhandle during the fall and winter months.  We are trying to get this fee before Thanksgiving, so Kerry and I can head to Austin and file.   I know that with your support, we will be able to not just achieve this goal, but EXCEED it.

For many reasons, I have been evaluating what to do going forward.  No decisions have been made, but the fight for Freedom is slipping away as we fight about the perfect course of action.  And I look at individuals like Heather Fazio that made far more progress outside the party.  Now that does not mean I am leaving or going on my own...it just means I need to think.  Thank you all for you past and continued support. Okay so many of y'all took this is that I was thinking of leaving the party not the case at all. It's more of a re-evaluation of what my role is or can be and how effective and affective can I be. I've already let some know that I will not continue in the role of County coordinator for the state after the convention.
