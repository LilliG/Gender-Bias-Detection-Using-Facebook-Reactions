From 1958 to 1965, Dr. King and fellow civil rights leaders met with Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson at the White House to advocate for full citizenship rights for African Americans. Dr. King‚Äôs work led to landmark civil rights and poverty legislation. In 1964, Dr. King came to the White House East Room to witness President Lyndon B. Johnson sign the Civil Rights Act, which guaranteed equal access to public places and outlawed racial discrimination. Tragically, Dr. King was assassinated less than four years later, in 1968. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the bill that created a federal holiday in honor of Dr. King.
