Arnold Mooney for Alabama,,2019-06-16 08:03:00,"This Father‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôm thinking of a quote from American engineer Charles Kettering: ‚ÄúEvery father should remember one day his son will follow his example, not his advice.‚Äù  It‚Äôs not easy fortune-cookie wisdom, though - if you take it seriously, it should be a wake-up call. Because it means you can‚Äôt just repeat platitudes to your children - you must be working to be a good man to be a good father. Deeds, not words, matter.  My father, Arnold Senior, served America in the Army during World War II. He didn‚Äôt just tell me America was worth fighting for. He taught me by example. My father passed on the importance of the values he lived out in his daily life: responsibility, hard work, and integrity. I miss him every day. I‚Äôm grateful for the witness of my father, and grateful to see my sons growing up to become wonderful fathers. We need more fathers - and more men of character - in our country today. Today, my prayers are with all of the fathers struggling to live up to this monumental calling. I hope you‚Äôll pray for them today - and for me, as well. Fatherhood is a remarkable challenge, and it‚Äôs amazing any man lives up to it. Happy Father‚Äôs Day.",57,54,0,3,0,0,0,3,2522761307938963,ArnoldMooneyForAlabama,/story.php?story_fbid=2522761307938963&id=1441934166021688
