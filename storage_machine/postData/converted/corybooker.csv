Fear is toxic. Watching it used in politics angers me. Great presidents and states-people of the past called upon us as a nation - often in our most difficult and uncertain times - NOT to be led by our fears but by our courage. ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself""  Beware of leaders who sell, exaggerate, or inspire fear.  And in my life, I have found that the most dangerous voice of fear isn't from demagogues, or bigoted bloviators. The worst most toxic voice of fear are those voices we all face within.  The internal voices that can pick up the toxic talk around us and echo it within; the voices that tell us not to try;  the voices that tell us not to risk extending a hand, speaking up, or giving to another; The internal voices that try to make us believe life is a zero sum, dog eat dog, scarcity world.  No, we are and the world is so much larger than that.  Whether the talk comes from a voice on the evening news, or one inside may we remember that:  Fear fractures. Love expands  Fear limits. Love expands.  Fear is small. Love expands.  Fear diminishes power. Love expands it.  Fear kills dreams. Love expands them.  I believe in the limitless possibilities of individuals. When we confront fear, conquer it, and approach life with a defiant faith and courageous empathy we expand life and life's possibilities.  That is also the story of this nation as well. We are not small, our dream, our promise can not be undercut by small minds or fear peddling hucksters.  Our generosity to Europe after the war (The Marshall Plan), the courage of black, white, Jewish, Christian Americans who loved so fearlessly they faced death together (Goodman, Cheney and Schwerner fighting for voting rights in Mississippi), our nation is replete with heroic tales of those who led with faith and love, not fear.  I am an imperfect exponent of such values. But perhaps a courageous ideal is just getting up everyday - despite our hurt, pain and fears - and trying again, to lead with love and more faithfully face the world.From my local assemblyman,  Hal Wirths.
