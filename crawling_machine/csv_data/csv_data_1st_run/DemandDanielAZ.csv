We allow people to come into this country illegally and undocumented and then feed off of our welfare programs. This must come to an end. There is no future for a welfare state that has open borders. And that’s exactly what we’re becoming. A wall will act as a barrier to physically deter people from crossing our southern border illegally and increased resources for border patrol will bring back law and order. I support both measures. When elected to the U.S. Senate I will support President Trump’s plan to build the border wall and do everything I can to demand that my colleagues do the same. #DemandDaniel #AZSen",177,160,1,16,,,,13,134166711293434,/story.php?story_fbid=134166711293434&id=107899067253532

Through all of this, I’ve seen just how destructive the Federal Government is to our economy and our production. The worst part about how they conduct themselves is that most of what affects us in Arizona isn’t even voted on in Congress. It’s simply passed down from D.C. bureaucrats, who are accountable to nobody. This is how they have slowly but surely taken over vast portions of the U.S. economy. The parts that haven’t been taken over are being drowned in red tape. You and I don’t get a say in any of this because the process is controlled by a select few. There are many viable proposals in Congress right now that could fix this problem, such as the REINS Act, which would require Congress to approve all new regulations with significant financial impacts on the U.S. economy before they can go into effect. Government wealth confiscation is what's killing our small businesses in this country and when you send me to the U.S. Senate, I will demand that it comes to an end. We’ve come to a point where we have to start repealing laws and throwing out regulations that are suffocating our economy. #DemandDaniel #AZSen",48,46,1,1,,,,1,133629651347140,/story.php?story_fbid=133629651347140&id=107899067253532

We cannot continue to treat our veterans the way that they have been by the VA Hospital in Phoenix. It is completely unacceptable to have those who sacrifice everything to defend our Republic die while on a waiting list to receive care. I wish it were just limited to Phoenix, but these long wait times have continued to be uncovered at VA hospitals all over the country. There is no excuse for this kind of negligence. It’s going to take new leadership to change this in Washington because the status quo is complete failure. 22 American veterans commit suicide every day. Many veterans coming home from active duty overseas speak about the struggles they face. Many say they worry about those left behind, still fighting. Some speak with regret of being thrust into combat, not knowing if the enemies are jihadists or simply farmers who want them out of their country. Many speak of the night terrors they face, the strain on their families, and the failures of our veteran healthcare system to provide anything but pills to numb their pain. Congress has failed all of us. The U.S. Constitution empowers Congress to declare war. Yet, few in Congress have the backbone to stand up for our soldiers. The most sacred constitutional duty is to decide where and when to send our children off to war, and Congress has effectively handed this power over to unelected bureaucrats and special interests. This is unacceptable.

Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-30 15:59:38,"ON HEALTHCARE The current debate on healthcare unfortunately is coming down to two false choices. D.C. Democrats and Republicans are insistent that our only options for healthcare in this country are: 1. Handing over all control to giant corporations  2. Giving all control to corrupt bureaucrats in the Federal Government There is absolutely no logic to either position, but yet this is what we're told to believe.  The establishment is doubling down on the disaster that is Obamacare while allowing corporate monopolies to control the rest of the system. If we know that neither will work, why are these the only choices that we are being given?  This system isn’t working. We all know it and must stop repeating the same mistakes. What if people could be in control of their own healthcare choices again? The left is proposing what they call ""Medicare for All,"" which is an even worse transfer of control of our healthcare system to big government and giant corporations.  And the costs are estimated to be 3.5 trillion every single year. The leftists who are proposing this plan have no idea how to pay for it, but they are hoping that their supporters will just buy into this unworkable scheme, at the expense of us all. The healthcare system in this country makes up nearly 18% of our overall economy. Turning that entire system over to un-elected and corrupt bureaucrats is not something that I'm prepared to tolerate and I know that you won't either.  The answer is not, has never been and will never be socialized medicine, Obamacare or ""Medicare for All."" The answer is to open back up the free markets and put people back in control of their healthcare. #DemandDaniel #AZSen",59,51,1,7,,,,9,132686254774813,/story.php?story_fbid=132686254774813&id=107899067253532

It is completely unacceptable to have those who sacrifice everything to defend our Republic die while on a waiting list to receive care. I wish it were just limited to Phoenix, but these long wait times have continued to be uncovered at VA hospitals all over the country. There is no excuse for this kind of negligence. It’s going to take new leadership to change this in Washington because the status quo is complete failure. 22 American veterans commit suicide every day. Many veterans coming home from active duty overseas speak about the struggles they face. Many say they worry about those left behind, still fighting. Some speak with regret of being thrust into combat, not knowing if the enemies are jihadists or simply farmers who want them out of their country. Many speak of the night terrors they face, the strain on their families, and the failures of our veteran healthcare system to provide anything but pills to numb their pain. Congress has failed all of us. The U.S. Constitution empowers Congress to declare war. Yet, few in Congress have the backbone to stand up for our soldiers.

Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-20 17:32:58,"I am the only candidate in this race who DEMANDS in no uncertain terms a border wall. It must happen and the DC Establishment is NOT serious about supporting our President to make it happen. There is NOTHING more to talk about until we have a wall. Period. This week establishment sycophants tried to attack me for DEMANDING unity and having personal compassion for the Mexican people. They live in hell. Their government is corrupt. The cartels are destroying these peoples' lives. Personally, I think the power-brokers in DC don’t want the American people to start thinking about how easily useless politicians can be removed.  We need those seeking a better life to come to America LEGALLY. As I said, I would be the FIRST person at the border to help with humanitarian efforts. They say I support ""annexation,"" and I do. Politicians have done nothing meaningful when it comes to getting the WALL BUILT. They've stood in the way for too long. They've assisted the cartels and the drug pushers and the criminals by their inaction. That's why I SUPPORT ANNEXING THE DC SWAMP TO MEXICO. Join me and tell these politicians to move across the border if they're not going to do anything about it!

Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-20 15:04:49,"Lots of concerned citizens are asking my stance on gun-rights and red flag laws, and I don’t blame them. Only a week ago, a major presidential candidate got on stage and proudly threatened us, promising that the Democrats WILL be taking our guns.  We should all be concerned about promises like that. I’m especially concerned about Republicans that are willing to give ground on this issue.  That’s the way the game is played by the Washington Establishment; The Democrats call for total insanity, and then the Republicans offer a compromise for just a little bit of insanity. And so, slowly, Americans’ rights are stripped away.  So let me be clear: gun-rights are vital to our freedom. As Senator, I won’t give an inch of ground. I won’t fall for their trap. No new red flag laws for America, and no new red flag laws for Arizona.",434,372,16,37,3,2,4,61,127150621995043,/story.php?story_fbid=127150621995043&id=107899067253532
Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-17 15:02:58,"Happy Constitution Day, everyone!  John Adams, one of this country’s great Founding Fathers, once said in a letter to the American militia,  “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”  The problems facing this country all have roots that run deep in the immoral behavior of leaders, both within politics and without. Here are just a few that come to mind:  -Deceptively pushing through unwanted Obamacare.  -The greedy lenders who caused the Great Recession. -Misusing taxpayer’s dollars to bail out those very same lenders.  -Hollywood’s hypocrisy and agenda.  -The constant flood of lies pouring out of the Mainstream Media.  Anyone with kids (I have four) knows that one of the first things you teach them is that actions have consequences, and that if they want to live a good life, then they must live well. Live morally.  Evidently no one taught the members of the Swampy Establishment this, but I intend to do just that when I get to Washington, and I will demand morals.",49,41,,8,,,,3,125356138841158,/story.php?story_fbid=125356138841158&id=107899067253532
Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-15 11:21:05,"The support from all of you over these last few weeks is overwhelming and so encouraging. So many of you are ready to demand more of their government. More liberty, more morality, more freedom!  Americans like you are worth fighting for.  Don't miss out on any of the big things we have planned.

Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-12 12:05:12,"I’ve been getting lots of great questions about what I mean by “states rights,” so let me be clear: the 10th Amendment, laid out plainly in our Bill of Rights, explicitly empowers people in their states to be in control of their own lives.  How we pray and worship isn’t any of the federal government’s business.  How we raise our families and educate our children isn’t any of the federal government’s business.  How we defend ourselves isn’t any of the federal government’s business.  The Swamp has no place in Arizona, and it should have no control over you. I’m demanding states rights, and I hope you’ll join me.",76,63,1,11,,,1,10,122360459140726,/story.php?story_fbid=122360459140726&id=107899067253532
Daniel McCarthy for US Senate,,2019-09-12 10:44:12,"Arizona’s representation belongs to US, not a handful of DC insiders who pick and choose candidates. This country is at a tipping point. We are on the teetering edge of socialism, endless cronyism, and government invading every freedom our founders held dear when they wrote the Declaration of Independence. Their divine vision for this nation guides my desire to forsake my private goals and serve the men and women of this great state. Together, we will make sure a principled leader wins this seat. I’ve listened to so many of you who’ve demanded change, demanded different outcomes from DC, and demanded the Constitution and our people be put FIRST – NOT bureaucratic, elitists who only serve themselves. That is why I am running for United States Senate. You’ve not only demanded a new candidate, you’ve demanded core principles that lead to prosperity, stability, and the American Dream. And those principles will be the pillar of my campaign. As your United States Senator, I will: 1. Demand Limited Government 2. Demand The Wall 3. Demand State Rights 4. Demand Transparency 5. Demand Accountability 6. Demand The Best Healthcare 7. Demand Unity 8. Demand Common Sense 9. Demand Entrepreneurship 10. Demand Inspiration 11. Demand Morals 12. Demand Strength 13. Demand Innovation 14. Demand Constitution 15. Demand Fortitude 16. Demand Perseverance 17. Demand Persistence 18. Demand Uniqueness Career politicians who continue to fester in the Swamp have begged me not to run. They want their candidate, who will push their agenda, who will be a yes-woman to their desires. I’m running because we’re in a fight for the heart of America and the status quo will no longer cut it for Arizonans. I will continue to listen to you, Arizona. I’m in this fight with you. #AzSen #DemandDaniel",131,100,10,17,1,,3,34,122319902478115,/story.php?story_fbid=122319902478115&id=107899067253532
