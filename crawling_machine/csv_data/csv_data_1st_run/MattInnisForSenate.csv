"Matt Innis for US Senate, Inc.",,2020-01-03 16:16:05,"According to Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), “…the genesis of impeachment, to be very candid with you, was when the president was running for office and he had members of his own party to talk about his unfitness to hold office.” Who was one of those “members of his own party” calling the president unfit? That’s right - Ben Sasse. Sasse repeatedly called Trump “unfit” while on Jake Tappers’ CNN show during the 2016 campaign and after Trump was elected, giving Democrats the incentive for the flawed impeachment process.  Sasse also gave cover to the Democrats and liberal media regarding the whistleblower report - prior to the release of the transcript - when he stated that “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons…when there’s obviously lots troubling in there.” It’s obvious that the liberals are taking their cues from people like Ben Sasse; his lack of respect for the President certainly doesn’t reflect my values and, from what I’ve been hearing from virtually everyone I talk with as I travel the state, he doesn’t reflect the values of conservative Nebraskans, either.

It would decimate agriculture, which is Nebraska’s top industry. Want to know where I stand on other issues?

I support a measure that would limit Members of Congress to two six-year terms in the U.S. Senate and six two-year terms in the House of Representatives, allowing a person to serve 12 years in each office.
