Talk to the people you're standing in line with at the grocery store.  Talk to people at the bus stop.  Spread the word that Bernie is not out of the race yet!Y’all with your negativity. Bernie is within 6% of Biden with delegates. There are almost 2500 delegates left. And I’ve listed the states and how many delegates are remaining.  Out of the states remaining, Bernie won a lot of those in 2016. I’ve also included a map of the 2016 results. There are a few differences in the map from 2016 with the 2020 map, one big difference is Bernie didn’t win California in 2016. Plus, he was further behind after Super Tuesday in 2016. It was not just 6% then. I’ve also included a picture of this. In addition, I’ve included a map of where we currently stand after Super Tuesday excluding Maine which was decided for Biden today.  If we can get some of the same states we got in 2016 (Michigan, Indiana) it will help. If we could gain Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, it would help.  Yes, Texas hurt, Maine hurt, Massachusetts hurts...but we still get a decent amount of delegates in those states.  Stay positive! Keep donating! Keep campaigning! Keep calling!!!! And, damnit, show up to vote!!! Going to rallies is not enough. Do not become complacent.  Bernie said he’d announce his VP after Super Tuesday, let’s hope that happens and let’s hope he hits it out of the park.
