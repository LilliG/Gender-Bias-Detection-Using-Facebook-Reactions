Barbara Bollier,,2020-02-24 14:06:14,"When I think about what public service really means to me, I always come back to the legacy of Senator Nancy Kassebaum. For those who don’t know, she was the first woman elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate in her own right, and the first female Senator from Kansas. My mom was a big supporter of Nancy’s, and did some work to help her get elected. We discussed her leadership a lot in my house growing up, and she’s someone I admire to this day.  In the Senate, Nancy was an independent thinker who worked across the aisle to get things done for Kansans.  She always put us first. That’s the kind of Senator I’ll be, too. She was an original co-sponsor of HIPAA, the landmark bipartisan legislation that protects patients’ private health information. As a doctor, I’ve seen firsthand just how important Nancy’s work is to people all over the country. And that’s only the beginning.  We’re all tired of career politicians — Nancy wasn’t one. When she felt she could help Kansans, she put her hat in the ring. And when she felt her time could be better spent as a grandmother, she gracefully retired.

This Holocaust Memorial Day, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I’m recommitting to the fight against discrimination and injustice in all its forms.On January 27, 1945 the German Nazi concentration and extermination Auschwitz-Birkenau camp was liberated. Today we commemorate the 75th anniversary of this event. At around 9 a.m. the first Soviet soldier from a reconnaissance unit of the 100th Infantry Division appeared on the grounds of the prisoners' infirmary in Monowitz. The entire division arrived half an hour later. The same day a military doctor arrived and began to organize assistance. In the afternoon soldiers of the Red Army entered the vicinity of the Auschwitz main camp and Birkenau. Near the main camp they met resistance from retreating German units. 231 Red Army soldiers died in close combat for the liberation of Auschwitz, Birkenau and Monowitz. Two of them died in front of the gates of Auschwitz main camp. One of them was Lieutenant Gilmudin Badryjewicz Baszirow. The first Red Army troops arrived in Birkenau and Auschwitz at around 3 p.m. and were joyfully greeted by the liberated prisoners. After the removal of mines from the surrounding area, soldiers of the 60th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front marched into the camp and brought freedom to the prisoners who were still alive. On the grounds of the main camp were 48 corpses and in Birkenau over 600 corpses of male and female prisoners who were shot or died in the last few days.

Barbara Bollier,,2019-12-12 17:44:14,"One year ago today, I changed my party registration and became a Democrat.  I’ll tell you the whole story: My parents were moderate Republicans in the mold of Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum. They taught me that Republicanism meant valuing public education, pursuing fiscal responsibility, and supporting governments that are close to the people they govern.  I’ve always believed that all people deserve the same rights, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation and women should be free to make their own reproductive choices — with whoever they choose to consult. Over time, I found the views of the Republican Party to be increasingly distant from my own. As a doctor, I advocated for commonsense solutions, not partisan politics. Meanwhile, the GOP rejected Medicaid expansion and comprehensive funding for public education. It had become clear to me that my values and my approach were no longer welcome by the Kansas Republican Party leadership, so I left the party and found a new home. A lot changed that day one year ago when I was welcomed with open arms by the Kansas Democratic Party — I got a new desk in the Senate chamber and joined some new committees. My party registration may have changed, but my values did not. I represent my constituents in Topeka the way I always have, and they have the same needs they’ve always had: affordable health care, quality public education, and accessible child care. I still work with the same colleagues and have the same relationships, on both sides of the aisle, as I always have. Red and blue must work together towards practical solutions based on scientific evidence and data, even in this deeply polarized era. I look forward to traveling the state and visiting with all Kansans regardless of their party affiliation. We have a bright future ahead of us.

Barbara Bollier,,2019-12-12 17:44:14,"One year ago today, I changed my party registration and became a Democrat.  I’ll tell you the whole story: My parents were moderate Republicans in the mold of Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum. They taught me that Republicanism meant valuing public education, pursuing fiscal responsibility, and supporting governments that are close to the people they govern.  I’ve always believed that all people deserve the same rights, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation and women should be free to make their own reproductive choices — with whoever they choose to consult. Over time, I found the views of the Republican Party to be increasingly distant from my own. As a doctor, I advocated for commonsense solutions, not partisan politics. Meanwhile, the GOP rejected Medicaid expansion and comprehensive funding for public education. It had become clear to me that my values and my approach were no longer welcome by the Kansas Republican Party leadership, so I left the party and found a new home. A lot changed that day one year ago when I was welcomed with open arms by the Kansas Democratic Party — I got a new desk in the Senate chamber and joined some new committees. My party registration may have changed, but my values did not. I represent my constituents in Topeka the way I always have, and they have the same needs they’ve always had: affordable health care, quality public education, and accessible child care. I still work with the same colleagues and have the same relationships, on both sides of the aisle, as I always have. Red and blue must work together towards practical solutions based on scientific evidence and data, even in this deeply polarized era. I look forward to traveling the state and visiting with all Kansans regardless of their party affiliation. We have a bright future ahead of us.

Barbara Bollier,,2019-10-16 08:32:37,"I became a doctor to help people. And I went into public service to fix things that were broken. I'm running to be your next US Senator to do both. As a doctor, I’ve never really been about partisan labels, just problem solving. And we need more of that right now. Instead of getting into political fights, I’ll focus on what matters most to families -- the cost of health care, child care, and how to save for retirement. Winning a Senate race in Kansas won’t be easy, but recent polls show we have a path. We can WIN this race, but we can’t do it without your help.
