Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2020-03-05 08:32:47,"From a paraeducator in Dubuque- ""Hey, Kimberly! I am a paraprofessional (also known as a teacher's aide), who works with kiddos who have autism. I have a teaching degree, but got in as a full-time para, and fell in love with my position. I want to remain as a para because I love it so much. I don't know how much information you may know about us, but we are often referred to as teachers' ""eyes, ears, arms, and legs."" We are also the ""frontliners."" We wear many hats, and our jobs can be quite challenging...just as it is for teachers (it's not for everybody). Sometimes, we are even mistaken for being teachers. In my medium sized school district, in Iowa, there is a para for every two teachers. There are secretary, health/nurse, multi-cat (gen. ed.), behavioral program, autism program, library, and security paras. Some of us work more one-on-one with students, while others stay with a general ed. class all day. Currently, our district's paras are trying to rejoin the union that we were previously a part of. We lost our union 2 years ago, due to one vote! If a person doesn't vote, it's considered a no vote, which is crazy! After 2 years, our paras can join a union again, which we are trying to do. Our collective bargaining rights were stripped away, in Iowa, back in 2017. They need to be brought back! We can only negotiate wages, and to a certain extent. Language and benefits are off the table, during negotiations. This does not give us much to work with. Some of our goals that we are trying to achieve are: a higher income, better benefits (it seems that paras are the only ones that have to pay for single payer insurance, in our district, and the family insurance is incredibly high...it takes most of our paycheck), as well as summer unemployment (our state reps. are trying to work on this for us...Iowa would be the first in the nation to do this for paraprofessionals, which is amazing). Our administration would love to be able to do more to support everybody (just like other schools), but our state funding is so low, and it barely covers inflation. Often teachers are put in the spotlight as far as trying to get better income, and paras seem to always be left behind. We feel we need a voice, too. We are a part of the glue that holds things together. Teachers definitely deserve better pay for what they do; they're incredible! I was a substitute teacher for quite some time, before I was hired as a para; I did long-term subbing. I know what their job entails, and they deserve better, but in my opinion and in others', paras should be paid at least half of what a teacher makes. Now, I am a member of an international paraeducator Facebook group. Some para members, across the US, have mentioned that their administrators and teachers pushed to eliminate a lot of their paras, and replace them with more teachers. Shortly after, teachers realized that it was a mistake on their part to push for that, and that they actually needed paras. Their jobs were even more challenging without them by their side, and they regretted their actions. Paras love their jobs...they love their kiddos. They're passionate about what they do, but many are financially struggling (not just in Iowa). Not everyone has a spouse to help support them. Actually, a lot of our paras are either single (like myself) or a single parent. Some are even the breadwinner. Many have to work 2-3 jobs just to try to make ends meet. There has to be a better answer. Some have student loan debt, medical bills, etc. in addition to their regular bills. I added up my paychecks from the last school year...I made $12,500, which included several trainings, summer school, and the times that I was able to stay a little later than my normal hours. What I make is what most of our district paras make. Our paras are considered to be the second highest paid in the state of Iowa! We are literally working at poverty level, according to our state reps. We deserve a livable income! According to my bank's financial stability rule...20/30/50. I can put $200 towards savings per month, $300 towards housing, and $500 towards everything else. According to my bank's housing calculator, I can only afford a $51k house. I would love to be able to purchase my parents' home (my childhood home), that I currently live in, when they decide to move, in the next several years. For the past 10 years, I've not been able to save much money due to my $85k student loan debt that I have acquired, and have been desperately trying to pay it off. Very soon I will be debt-free, and would love to be able to purchase a car, a home. However, without any change financially, I won't be able to afford to purchase my family's house, in the near future (at least not on my para income alone). This concerns me greatly. Please keep paras in mind while running for Senate. If possible, could you please not only put teachers in the spotlight, but paras as well? Please be an advocate for us! I feel a lot of people don't even know what a paraprofessional is and how important we are to our students. We wish more people knew what our jobs entailed and how valuable we are. We need to elect people who love and support our public schools, our kiddos, our teachers, our paras and staff...who have a drive, a good heart, and will listen to everyone's voice...taking action, when need be. I wish you all the best in your endeavors, and will continue to follow your page. Thank you for all you do!""",12,9,,2,,1,,2,2484843241776974,/story.php?story_fbid=2484843241776974&id=2217400561854578

"Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,Lilly Otto",Lilly Otto,2020-02-28 18:55:04,"Please help me amplify this message!Senator Joni Ernst Let me show you how to write a meaningful, compassionate letter. I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Lillian Otto. My sister is Roseanna Otto. Do those names mean anything to you? My guess is that they do not.  My sister, Roseanna Otto, was murdered on May 27, 2019 by her abusive ex-boyfriend. She left behind three children, dear family, and many friends who deserve to have her in their lives today. The current laws may seem adequate, but when you are personally affected by them, you start to notice the areas where they fall short. Since my sister’s death, I have completed extensive research on the topic of domestic abuse. I have noticed a devastating trend within the research I’ve completed, and I am going to do something about it.  I showed up to your office to hand deliver you over 45,000 signatures of people (including many of your constituents) who are disappointed in you & your lack of ability to stand up for victims.  That is how serious this issue is to me. The fact that your office had the audacity to send me a computer generated letter is insulting & infuriating. Do you have any compassion at all? Does the loss of a kind, caring, thoughtful, smart, funny, beautiful young mother of 3 not break your heart? Does that not make you want to keep that same outcome from happening to someone else?  If you think that your computer generated letter is going to appease me and make me go silent- you’re wrong. I will be fierce in the pursuit of what sets my soul on fire, and this issue, Ms Senator, sets my soul on fire.  Sincerely,  A mother, daughter, sister & friend who is just trying to protect others. #JusticeForRoseanna 💜 Please share.",14,8,,1,,,5,,2480585478869417,/story.php?story_fbid=2480585478869417&id=2217400561854578

I'm in this photo, taken last summer when I spent a day volunteering to help with flood cleanup.  We spent part of that day at Phyllis's home of 60 years - her home was basically destroyed, her possessions ruined, etc.   I'm so sad.   Chris Adcock- who organized and oversaw the volunteer efforts - sent a message to we who'd volunteered.  Part it says: ""Please remember that the work we did helping this incredibly warm, engaged and engaging former educator in the last months of her life was very important work.  Though we didn't ""fix"" anything, we did what neighbors do - help where we can, if we can. Never hesitate to put your heart into caring for others.  There is nothing more humbling or noble in the same moment."" Thanks for organizing the volunteer efforts, Chris -- without you I'd never have met Phyllis.

Not the commercialized version (and yes, there's a different version) but the version I celebrate.  On this day I take a moment to think about the people (and our dog and cats) I love and take care of.   We wrote and sent out this email today and I wanted to share it with you.   Happy Love Day, all! <3 ""Valentine’s Day is a good day to reflect on why I’m running for the U.S. Senate. It’s because I love the people of Iowa and want the best for each and every one of them. My son is an Iowan. My dad, brother and sister-in-law are Iowans. The kids I represent in juvenile court are Iowans. And every Iowan should be able to live a life of health and dignity.   Our campaign slogan is “Best Senator Money Can’t Buy” because we can only do the people’s work if we are not owned or influenced by corporations. You hear this a lot from progressive campaigns, but people-power can win over big money if we stay organized, work together for each other and love one another fiercely.  In short, love wins.   That’s why I’m here, and it’s why we must bolster our efforts to retake this U.S. Senate seat for the people of Iowa.  (Donation link went here in the email.  Hey, it takes $ to run a campaign! lol) If you’re from Iowa, you know how special our people are, and if you’re a supporter from another state, thank you for acting in solidarity to bring equality and justice back to the U.S. Senate.   Sticking together out of love for Iowa, for this country and all its people is our best hope to bring the change we need, and I can’t thank you enough for your support of this campaign and our movement.

Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2020-02-07 12:01:30,"I was honored to interact with supporters, organizers, and staff from every Presidential campaign since June, and I applaud all of them for their hard work. I was especially impressed by Senator Elizabeth Warren and her platform, which includes Medicare for All, investments in our children via universal childcare and universal pre-k, and assertive action on the climate crisis. While both Senators Sanders and Warren’s platforms align with our campaign.  I made the decision not to endorse either -- before the caucuses -- after many conversations with both the Sanders and Warren campaign organizers, staffers and supporters of each campaign.  Senator Sanders often says  “Not me, us.” To me, this means that the entire movement working to ensure all Americans live lives of health and dignity is far more important than any one individual.  The movement to obtain healthcare for all as a human right, to address the climate crisis, the movement to invest in our children, to increase union membership, to increase the minimum wage to a living wage, the movement to see that all in our state and in our nation have affordable and accessible housing, to see that people with disabilities live lives of inclusion and opportunity and the movement to ensure that we can all rise to our potential . . .it’s about us. This is about all of us.  Not me, us. Senator Warren and Senator Sanders both have the platforms that most Iowans agree with and that we need to live lives of health and dignity.  There is a depth and breadth to Senator Sanders’ coalition and a momentum to his campaign that I believe will carry him to the nomination for President. His campaign embodies the “not me, us” philosophy.  His campaign and this movement have inspired countless first-time voters, first-time caucus-goers and has inspired so many people to volunteer for a campaign or to donate for the first time in their lives.  Senator Sanders campaign has given hope to so many who were previously hopeless. For these reasons, and because our values are so closely aligned, I am endorsing Senator Sanders for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. I am calling upon all people who believe that everyone deserves to live a life of health and dignity to join together in this movement.  Unity is “we kind of want the same things.”  SOLIDARITY is “I have your back, you have mine and I will fight for you and you’ll fight for me.”  Solidarity is being willing to fight for someone you don’t know. We must unite our party and we must be willing to fight for those we don’t know so that every Iowan and every single American can live a life of health and dignity. I am also formally calling for the resignation of Tom Perez from the DNC and calling for a commission to reform the Iowa Caucuses. The DNC's decision to shoot down the accessible virtual caucus contributed to the failure of the past week.

"Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,Lilly Otto",Lilly Otto,2020-02-28 18:55:04,"Please help me amplify this message!Senator Joni Ernst Let me show you how to write a meaningful, compassionate letter. I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Lillian Otto. My sister is Roseanna Otto. Do those names mean anything to you? My guess is that they do not.  My sister, Roseanna Otto, was murdered on May 27, 2019 by her abusive ex-boyfriend. She left behind three children, dear family, and many friends who deserve to have her in their lives today. The current laws may seem adequate, but when you are personally affected by them, you start to notice the areas where they fall short. Since my sister’s death, I have completed extensive research on the topic of domestic abuse. I have noticed a devastating trend within the research I’ve completed, and I am going to do something about it.  I showed up to your office to hand deliver you over 45,000 signatures of people (including many of your constituents) who are disappointed in you & your lack of ability to stand up for victims.  That is how serious this issue is to me. The fact that your office had the audacity to send me a computer generated letter is insulting & infuriating. Do you have any compassion at all? Does the loss of a kind, caring, thoughtful, smart, funny, beautiful young mother of 3 not break your heart? Does that not make you want to keep that same outcome from happening to someone else?  If you think that your computer generated letter is going to appease me and make me go silent- you’re wrong. I will be fierce in the pursuit of what sets my soul on fire, and this issue, Ms Senator, sets my soul on fire.  Sincerely,  A mother, daughter, sister & friend who is just trying to protect others. #JusticeForRoseanna 💜 Please share.",14,8,,1,,,5,,2480585478869417,/story.php?story_fbid=2480585478869417&id=2217400561854578

Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2020-02-07 12:01:30,"I was honored to interact with supporters, organizers, and staff from every Presidential campaign since June, and I applaud all of them for their hard work. I was especially impressed by Senator Elizabeth Warren and her platform, which includes Medicare for All, investments in our children via universal childcare and universal pre-k, and assertive action on the climate crisis. While both Senators Sanders and Warren’s platforms align with our campaign.  I made the decision not to endorse either -- before the caucuses -- after many conversations with both the Sanders and Warren campaign organizers, staffers and supporters of each campaign.  Senator Sanders often says  “Not me, us.” To me, this means that the entire movement working to ensure all Americans live lives of health and dignity is far more important than any one individual.  The movement to obtain healthcare for all as a human right, to address the climate crisis, the movement to invest in our children, to increase union membership, to increase the minimum wage to a living wage, the movement to see that all in our state and in our nation have affordable and accessible housing, to see that people with disabilities live lives of inclusion and opportunity and the movement to ensure that we can all rise to our potential . . .it’s about us. This is about all of us.  Not me, us. Senator Warren and Senator Sanders both have the platforms that most Iowans agree with and that we need to live lives of health and dignity.  There is a depth and breadth to Senator Sanders’ coalition and a momentum to his campaign that I believe will carry him to the nomination for President. His campaign embodies the “not me, us” philosophy.  His campaign and this movement have inspired countless first-time voters, first-time caucus-goers and has inspired so many people to volunteer for a campaign or to donate for the first time in their lives.  Senator Sanders campaign has given hope to so many who were previously hopeless. For these reasons, and because our values are so closely aligned, I am endorsing Senator Sanders for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. I am calling upon all people who believe that everyone deserves to live a life of health and dignity to join together in this movement.  Unity is “we kind of want the same things.”  SOLIDARITY is “I have your back, you have mine and I will fight for you and you’ll fight for me.”  Solidarity is being willing to fight for someone you don’t know. We must unite our party and we must be willing to fight for those we don’t know so that every Iowan and every single American can live a life of health and dignity. I am also formally calling for the resignation of Tom Perez from the DNC and calling for a commission to reform the Iowa Caucuses. The DNC's decision to shoot down the accessible virtual caucus contributed to the failure of the past week.

Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2019-10-22 12:25:22,"More from Team Brownsville, the organization helping feed and school children of asylum seekers at the border.  As feared, the asylum seekers are being moved away from the actual border. Harder to reach them, impossible for Team Brownsville to feed them, far less safe for them, etc.  And -- out of sight of reporters and human rights watchers. ""In an effort to be clear to all our supporters about what’s going on in Matamoros with the Asylum seekers/MPP recipients , I’m posting this article from the Mexican newspaper El Bravo. The most critical portion of this article, from the stand point of the asylum seekers and the humanitarian aid organizations that work with them is this: On October 28th, the asylum seeking people are to be moved to a large event center area in Matamoros, called Mundo Nuevo. We don’t know if this is a forced relocation or a voluntary one. Mundo Nuevo is about 10 miles from the plaza entrance to the bridge. This will limit our access to the people and make it difficult if not impossible to serve them with meals and supplies , to say nothing of our Escuelita program. According to the article , this came about because of the protest on the bridge held two weeks ago. We want you to know that we are fighting this decision , that we stand ready to continue doing the work we do. We are alerting the news media and others who might make an impact in ensuring that there are not major human right violations. We will continue doing the work we are doing , for as long as we are needed , up until our last breath. Thank you for staying with us through the long haul. Your prayers and well wishes are welcome for all of the asylum seeking people in Matamoros and those who minister to them. #teambrownsville #seekingasylumislegal #walkinlove 💙🌎❤️ http://www.elbravo.mx/desalojaran-a-migrantes-del-puente-nuevo-a-partir-del-28-de-octubre/?fbclid=IwAR0yzqmXS2Q9OmZQFsoj_hAcwbE6FsCDLmUvVyyySl5JQiu61hqbdABpW_M",15,6,,,,4,5,,2365333667061266,/story.php?story_fbid=2365333667061266&id=2217400561854578

In fact, the end of this thread will contain a donation link and a solicitation, but I wanted to say something first. While it is important to turn the Senate Blue, Democrats also need to stand for something. It isn't good enough to just not be Republicans. We need to present a counter narrative to the GOP, a narrative of economic, social, climate and political justice that can compete with Republicans bleak vision of the future.

Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2019-05-31 10:42:51,"""'The delays are the worst on record,” Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodity strategist at JPMorgan, told the Wall Street Journal. “We’re in uncharted waters.'” The delayed planting due to the unprecedented weather would be bad enough.  Combine that with the endless and increasingly devastating trade war, markets that are lost for now and some lost forever, and our rural communities are in some serious trouble.   I'm not seeing either the current president or our US senators getting anything substantial done to help -- short, medium or long-term. https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/a-new-accuweather-analysis-predicts-a-significant-dropoff-in-2019-crop-yields/70008414",29,11,,,,18,,3,2261669024094398,/story.php?story_fbid=2261669024094398&id=2217400561854578
Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2019-04-28 23:23:28,"The ""tax cuts"" passed last year were for the mega-rich, not to benefit us, the majority. ""But a new analysis of all Fortune 500 companies found only 4.3 percent of workers will receive a one-time bonus or wage increase tied to the business tax cuts, while businesses received nine times more in cuts than what they passed on to their workers, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, a political advocacy group devoted to tax reform. The analysis also found that companies spent 37 times as much on stock buybacks than they did on bonuses and increased wages for workers."" https://www.newsweek.com/republican-tax-cuts-trump-wage-increases-879800?fbclid=IwAR1BKM_66txzQnoq2KZUfqxDVEiXsEUW5v2ggZb3Ind0FPi1RGk-r32itIw",1,1,,,,,,,2239980379596596,/story.php?story_fbid=2239980379596596&id=2217400561854578

Kimberly Graham for US Senate - Iowa,,2019-03-30 00:16:45,"I attended a campaign event for Senator Elizabeth Warren tonight. Afterward, she stayed as long as it took for everyone to get a picture with her. I've followed her career for at least 10 years, and her work to advocate for everyday people rather than advocating for corporations.  Having her policies and presence in the White House would be amazing, and we are so lucky to have so many excellent candidates for 2020!",47,26,,21,,,,2,2221826544745313,/kimberlyforiowa/photos/a.2220336324894335/2221826544745313
