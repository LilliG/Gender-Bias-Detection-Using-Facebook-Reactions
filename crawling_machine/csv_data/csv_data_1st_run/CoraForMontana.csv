Link to register: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gallatinbluewave2020#GallatinBlueWave2020 Candidate Profile: U.S. Senate Cora Neumann ""Cora Neumann is a public health leader and public lands expert with two decades of experience improving access to health care, expanding economic development, and protecting access to public lands. When Cora was six months old, her father died from a lumber mill accident, caused by a lack of safety mechanisms. Cora didn’t understand it then, but her loss was an example of what can happen when we put corporate interests over workers. In addition, her father’s death demonstrated the challenges of rural healthcare – if they had had access to better care, her father may have lived. Despite that hardship, Cora’s mother picked herself up and attended nursing school at MSU while working nights to take care of Cora and her older brother. When she was six years old, Cora’s stepfather - a union carpenter - came into her life. When times got hard in Bozeman, Cora watched him commute the long hours to Great Falls for work. Cora learned from them both what dedication to family, community, and hard work look like. Cora took those values with her as she worked up to four jobs to pay for college, including as a union laborer and waitress, ultimately earning a Masters and Doctorate in Public Health and International Development from Columbia University and Oxford University (UK). In 2009, Cora launched the Global First Ladies Alliance in partnership with the offices of First Ladies Laura Bush and Michelle Obama. The organization empowers first ladies around the world – including American first ladies and presidents from both parties – to stay accountable to hardworking families and use their power to do more for their constituents. Cora worked with more than 40 first ladies and presidents around the world to empower women and families, improve access to health care, promote economic development, education and more. Cora then served at the State Department in the Economic Bureau, where she focused on job creation, economic diplomacy and women’s economic development. She advocated for access to parental leave and promoted women’s entrepreneurship across the globe. Since 2015, as Founder and CEO of RESET, Cora has been working throughout the Rocky Mountains to bring together conservation leaders, ranchers, hunters, Native communities, and young people to collaborate on new ways to protect public lands. With support from Grand Canyon Trust, Patagonia, and others, RESET has launched major new advocacy efforts to protect Bears Ears National Monument, released a collaborative, bipartisan storytelling campaign, and organized a series of leadership workshops for Native women. Cora lives with her family in Bozeman surrounded by four generations of family, from her grandmother and grandfather to her two children, Timea and Levi.""

Cora Neumann,,2020-02-11 16:13:01,"It’s official! We have filed to get our campaign on the ballot! I’m running for Senate because GOP Senator Steve Daines is putting our children’s future at risk and I couldn’t just sit back and let it happen. This campaign is about Montana families and fighting for affordable, accessible health care, keeping our lands public and ensuring economic opportunity for everyone. “HELENA — Democrat Cora Neumann of Bozeman has become the second Democrat to file for Montana’s 2020 U.S. Senate race, competing for her party’s nomination to challenge Republican Sen. Steve Daines. Neumann, 44, a public-health and public-lands expert from Bozeman, paid her $1,740 filing fee this past weekend to secure her spot on the primary election ballot. In a statement provided to MTN News, Neumann said Daines is “putting our children’s future at risk” on various policy fronts. “I just couldn’t sit back and let it happen,” she said. “This campaign is about Montana families and fighting for affordable health care, accessible health care, keeping our lands public and ensuring economic opportunity for everyone.” Daines, a first-term Republican, hasn’t paid his filing fee yet, but is running for re-election. Neumann grew up in Bozeman, but only recently moved back to the state. She most recently worked on public-lands protection efforts for a nonprofit group and as interim director for a foundation battling pediatric brain cancer. Neumann has a master’s degree in public health from Columbia University in New York and a doctorate in international development from Oxford University in Oxford, England. So far, Neumann has raised more money than any other Democratic candidate in the race, reporting $460,000 in donations the last three months of 2019. Daines has raised $6.6 million and had $5 million in his campaign account on Dec. 31. The other Democrats in the race are Loma rancher John Mues, Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins and Bozeman physicist Michael Knoles. Mues is the only other Senate candidate, so far, who’s paid his filing fee. The deadline for filing fees is March 9.”",162,118,,44,,,,3,203041724421296,/story.php?story_fbid=203041724421296&id=123433462382123

Cora Neumann,,2020-01-11 11:51:23,"Really great story about our first quarter on Montana Public Radio! Please listen if you have a chance. Partial transcript below: ""Mauk: .... Holly, in the U.S. Senate race, another Democratic newcomer, Cora Neumann of Bozeman, reports she raised $460,000. And that's an impressive figure for someone, I dare say, few Montanans have heard of. Michels: Her campaign released some pretty notable numbers earlier in the week, and people I interviewed said it makes a pretty strong statement for her in this primary. We talked about this before, but a lot of people were encouraging Democratic Governor Steve Bullock to run for the Senate, saying that he'd be the party's best chance to unseat Republican Senator Steve Daines in a field without candidates who have a lot of name recognition around the state. Neumann's numbers are pretty impressive. I think it's important to note, though, that Daines is still far and away ahead of anyone else in the money race. He raised $5.2 million so far, has about $4.2 million In the bank. We haven't seen his most recent filings, but safe to say he's still ahead there. But Neumann's numbers could shake up the race. I spoke with John Mues, another Democrat who's running. He raised about $100,000 in his first quarter and then largely stepped away in the most recent quarter to deal with a family medical emergency. And Wilmot Collins, Helena mayor, who's also running, he's raised about $176,000 so far, and we haven't seen his fourth quarter numbers yet. So it'll be interesting to see where those come in. Mauk: Neumann has a new ad out online outlining her priorities and a bit of her personal story. Neumann ad: ""One log shaped my entire life, I was a baby. My dad was at work at the lumber mill and the company was cutting corners and being unsafe. A log fell and cracked his skull. Had we lived closer to a good hospital, my dad might have survived, but he didn't."" Mauk: And Rob, this ad starts off as many Montana political ads do, with the candidate outdoors, splitting wood, in blue jeans, etc. And it has a moving personal story before going on to list the candidate's priorities, one of which is health care, which her personal story illustrates. I think it's a well done ad. Saldin: Yeah, strong out of the gate. You know, look, number one goal for a new unknown candidate is to boost that name I.D., right? Nobody knows who Neumann is. So the first thing she's got to do is establish her bio and give people something to remember. And she does a nice job of that here with this very tough story about her dad's death and her childhood. And that's all nicely interwoven with some classic Montana scenes and activities, but also some classic Montana populist notes, right? She has this image that she's trying to cultivate, apparently, of being a fighter for average Montanans against corporate elites. That comes up a number of times in the ad, right? So it's a kind of this corporate interests vs. Montana families. And Steve Daines is, of course, with the bad guys and she's with the good guys. The health care bit Sally, you're right, that comes up a number of times. That's straight out of the Democrat's playbook from two years ago, that midterm election, which they did very well running behind that. She, also in this ad, pushes that independent button a bit. She's obviously running as a Democrat, but the ad makes special note of her work, not just with Michelle Obama, but also with Laura Bush, right? So that's a nice touch that clearly puts some distance between her and her party's left flank. The AOCs of the world in ""the squad"" and that whole crowd. So that's another just nice way that she's able to try to define herself. So given the political culture of Montana, you know, those those are all pretty good notes to hit. And again, it's all kind of nicely packaged together with that personal story of hers, which reinforces the broader themes. Mauk: Holly, she will be facing, if she were to win the Democratic nomination, Senator Steve Daines. And this week he signed-on to a resolution urging a quick end to the impeachment process against President Trump. He calls impeachment, ""a political game."" And he all but says he will vote against it in the Senate. We'd be shocked if he didn't. Michels: Yeah, Senator Daines has made no secret he's been opposed to impeachment from day one. That resolution that you mentioned, it's highly unlikely that would pass the Senate since it would need 67 votes, and Republicans have 53 members. So this just shows another time where Daines has aligned with Trump, which is something he's done pretty aggressively. One of the times I remember is when Daines made a point to stand pretty publicly behind a tweet where Trump said that four Democratic freshmen members of the House should go back to the places they came from and fix those three. The women that Trump was referencing in those tweets were born in the U.S. and all four obviously U.S. citizens. It's a situation like this where some Republicans didn't really weigh in on this, but Daines did. And you didn't have to respond. This is freshman members in the House, not in the Senate, and not directly related to Montana in any way. But Daines did choose to respond in a way that got a lot of attention. Mauk: Well, this week, a few dozen people gathered outside Daines' office in Missoula to both protest his support of Trump's Middle East policy and his opposition to impeachment. And the rally was co-sponsored by the activist group Missoula Rises, and Missoula County Democrats. And here's what county Democratic leader Karen Wickersham had to say to Senator Daines. Wickersham: ""We demand you put country above party. Hold this president accountable for his reckless actions. And we demand that you support a fair trial in the Senate. We want witnesses, we want documents."" Mauk: Rob, there is no question, I think, that President Trump will be an issue in both of Montana's congressional races, the House and Senate races. Saldin: Yeah, for sure. And I think also on one level, it's not at all surprising that Daines is linking himself to President Trump. Montana's a Trump state. And of course, Daines and Trump are both Republicans, and politics is a team sport. But Holly, I think what you noted is correct, that some of the choices that Daines makes, that makes it notable. And you could say the same thing in many cases about Congressman Gianforte too. It's the degree to which they have linked themselves to Trump, right? Frequently with no caveats or qualifications, just total unmitigated devotion. And in Daines' case in particular, it's a little hard to square, I think, with how he presented himself early in his political career, right? As a decent, honest family man, traditional values, all that. So when it comes in a broad way to Republicans supporting Trump back in Washington, you can see some variation in the levels of enthusiasm out there, right? A lot of Republicans stay quiet about certain things and don't necessarily go out of their way to advertise, just, total adherence, but Daines is one of those who really has gone all in. And Holly. you brought up the bit about the four members of ""the squad."" The one that I remember best, a Twitter moment pushed out by Daines, is that birthday cake message that he sent out. Do you remember this? I'm sure you can find it still online. It featured a shot of a birthday cake and the icing on the cake depicted him and Trump in the Oval Office. And it all came off as a little bit fawning and sycophantic to me. And, thing is, Holly, as you noted, he doesn't have to do all that stuff. That's a choice. And he does it pretty routinely. And I guess either because he truly does love the president or because he thinks it's in his immediate political interest to do so. And in terms of this campaign cycle, that may well be right. Long term, though, I do wonder if Daines will come to regret how eager he's been to wrap himself around the president. Mauk: In terms of the political calculation, President Trump still polls very well in Montana, not as high as he was polling after he was elected, but certainly he still has the majority support in Montana. So Daines certainly is well aware of that. We'll keep track of all of this. And Rob, Holly, stay warm this weekend, we'll reconvene next week.'",15,15,,,,,,,179591986766270,/story.php?story_fbid=179591986766270&id=123433462382123

Cora Neumann,,2019-10-21 20:30:03,"I’m running for Senate because Montana’s families need a leader fighting for good jobs and higher wages. Are you with me? Add your name now. This week I launched my “Wibaux to Wisdom” statewide tour and we have been hearing about employment issues all over the state. Our federal agricultural policies have left farmers behind. We’ve allowed wages to fall in our transition from a natural resource economy to tourism and renewable economies. It is unacceptable and we must do better. The cost of living in Montana continues to go up and wages are stagnant - Montana’s minimum wage will go up 15 cents this January - from $8.50/hour to $8.65. Again: we must do better. When I’m serving in the U.S. Senate, I will fight for good jobs and higher wages for all of Montana's families.
