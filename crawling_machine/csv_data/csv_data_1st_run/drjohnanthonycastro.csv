John Anthony Castro,,2020-03-04 09:00:53,"I announced my candidacy less than 5 weeks ago on February 1st. I had originally planned on running for office in 2022. But the current state of politics compelled me to run this year. In just a little over a *single* month, we went from being entirely unknown to being the only challenger to John Cornyn to seize and win a county in Texas (McMullen County!) and deny him a unanimous victory. The term “campaign” is a military term. It means “a connected series of military operations forming a distinct phase of a war.” This 2020 Primary was just one small operation in a larger campaign. We now know our strengths. But more importantly, we know our enemy’s weaknesses. This war is not over. We now move onto preparing for 2022! 🇺🇸",154,125,3,25,1,,,23,944104839339186,/story.php?story_fbid=944104839339186&id=672213539861652

John Anthony Castro,,2020-03-03 10:44:49,"Oh what a coincidence. Election Day comes and all of a sudden the “find my voting station” feature on the Texas Secretary of State’s office isn’t working.

This is what elections are about! Corporations get billions in handouts and subsidies, but God forbid if hardworking American families dare to ask for anything. No more! I’m running for U.S. Senate to be YOUR champion. But I can’t do it without YOUR vote.",39,31,5,2,,1,,10,940604149689255,/story.php?story_fbid=940604149689255&id=672213539861652
John Anthony Castro,,2020-01-31 09:03:43,"I am today announcing my candidacy for United States Senate.  The U.S. Senate is the most influential body in the Free World.  Through its chambers can come the solutions to many of our nation’s most pressing issues affecting every family in America.  The hopes of the American people are contingent upon effective leadership in the U.S. Senate.  Healthcare for all hardworking American families, a college education without concern for finances and relief from crushing student loan debt, living wages for all hardworking Americans, trade policies that increase income and build wealth for all Americans, an immigration system that works, and a public works project to expand the use of wind and hydroelectric energy to drive down utility bills and protect our environment. These are the real issues of the 2020s.  These are the issues that the American people must focus squarely on when they cast their ballot. Over the past decade, I have traveled all over the United States and spoken to Americans at every corner of our great nation.  My emphasis on solutions and focus on building unity between Democrats and Republicans has led every single one to plead with me to offer my service to the American people. This is not a campaign about one person.  This is a campaign to end the rigged system we currently live in and make it fair for everyone.  This is a campaign to end the system that crushes you with debt to acquire an education.  This is a campaign to ensure you have access to health care you can afford.  This is a campaign to ensure that every hardworking American does not have to live in poverty.  This is a campaign to implement solutions to real problems you’re actually facing in your life.  This is a campaign for your future.  This campaign is about you. It is on this basis that I begin my campaign for the United States Senate.",764,633,12,112,5,,2,38,920114595071544,/story.php?story_fbid=920114595071544&id=672213539861652
