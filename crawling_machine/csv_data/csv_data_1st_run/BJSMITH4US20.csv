Why did your father-in-law lavish you with between $5 - $25 million? 7. Why did Transportation Secretary Chao lavish you with $78 million for your campaign re-election bid? 8. Why did you deliberately block President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and vow to fill a vacancy in 2020 for President Trump?!? 9. Why did you accept campaign donations from two Voting Machine Manufacturers just prior to your re-election bid and choose to block Elections Security legislation that would ensure protection against further Russian interference into our 2020 elections? 10.

Universal Background Checks on all gun sales, including at retail stores, online, gun shows and private sales B. Ban on all or most Military-Style Assault Weapons and C. Limited Magazine Capacity? 13. Why did you deliberately LIE to the Coal Miners blaming the decline on the coal industry on Democrats and President Obama? And why did our COAL MINERS have to take a 10-hour bus ride to DC to get your attention about the BLACK LUNG DISEASE FUND?  14. How is it that you became one of the wealthiest Senators in the 5th poorest state and we still rank at or near the bottom when it comes to education, economic, health and environmental concerns? Final question: 15. Why haven't you or President Trump visited the Coal Miners in Cumberland, KY to address their concerns when you are home campaigning? benniejsmith.com https://ballotpedia.org/Bennie_Smith",,,,,,,,,645895295978660,/story.php?story_fbid=645895295978660&id=396578117577047

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-03-04 04:39:32,"Bennie J. Smith is running for U.S. SENATOR 2020 (D-KY) as a change agent to repair the damage ADDISON MITCHELL McCONNELL aka ""MOSCOW MITCH"" and ""THE GRIM REAPER"" has caused. He also wants to offer the citizens in the Commonwealth of Kentucky a more positive and upbeat representative who has all their best interests at heart. At an early age growing up in the housing projects of Charlotte Court on the west side of Lexington, Kentucky, Bennie J. knew he wanted to do and be something more. He experienced a two-parent setting until he was 10 years old, whereas, his parents separated and divorced. The family then moved to Danville and as a way to address his aggressions, he learned to play the alto saxophone in the 5th grade at Toliver Elementary School. He credits music as being lifesaving. He drew inspiration from his visually impaired mother as she raised 4 kids to adulthood while on public assistance and food stamps. She also sacrificed a portion of her SSI check to make monthly payments on a horn rental while he was in the 5th through 7th grades to ensure he had an instrument to practice and play on. So he credits his mother for instilling compassion while overcoming any and all life obstacles and credits his father for instilling the work ethic he so passionately attained. He also credits summer camps (YMCA CAMP DANIEL BOONE and TROOPER ISLAND) and the association of mentors from Big Brothers/Big Sisters as other lifechanging experiences. As the eldest of four, he was always the adventurous one as he met no strangers during his life's journey. Bennie J. is a 1976 graduate of Lafayette High School and earned college credit hours after attending Kentucky State University and Eastern Kentucky University. He was also the first male graduate from the Lexington Urban League's Word Processing Training Program. He hopes his work as a civil and human rights activist as well as his roles as a parent and grandparent will give him an edge in being more empathetic to other people's needs and concerns as well as gain the support of Kentucky voters.

I suspect many adherents don't understand what they've become. Sometimes things are hard to see. Don't take this to mean I think the majority of the democratic establishment are democratic. Taking corporate bribes (campaign financing) and acting on behalf of the 607 billionaires who have a stranglehold on all our lives is what allowed Trumpism to rise in the first place. But we're taking our power back. The mask is off them as well. Nobody claiming to represent the general public has any business taking money from corporations, banks, fossil fuels or tech.  And any institution that’s oppressive and not in service to the people ought to be held accountable to us to regulate, improve, change, dismantle, or rethink.  That is true whether it’s Dupont, congress, the IRS, ICE, the criminal justice system, the federal reserve, Facebook, a political party, the constitution, the health insurance industry or the presidency. That’s what democracy means. People rule.  So it’s in our best interest to give us all the best education we can. And an equitable participation in our economy. Regardless of what family you’re born into. That’s what real patriotism looks like. A humans first approach.

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-02-27 08:27:23,"A GREAT HISTORICAL FACT DEMANDS A GREAT HISTORICAL COMPROMISE by Bennie J. Smith (A Repost from April 14, 2019) MY EFFORTS TO COMPROMISE ON THE PLAYING OF THE KENTUCKY STATE SONG, ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME"" with FOLLOWUP OF PLAYING ""LIFT EVERY VOICE"" AT THE KENTUCKY DERBY AS WELL AS UK, UofL, WKU, EKU, and MURRAY STATE BASKETBALL and FOOTBALL GAMES ENABLED ME TO REACH OUT TO EACH OF THE SCHOOLS' BAND DIRECTORS. I WAS ABLE TO SPEAK WITH AND GET CONTACT INFO FROM EVERYONE EXCEPT UK's BAND DIRECTOR: Hello TIM, SCOTT, AMY, & J. FANNIN!!! I pray this note finds you and your associates at EKU, WKU, UofL, and MURRAY STATE in the best of health and spirits.  I am Bennie J. Smith, Candidate for the U.S. SENATE RACE in 2020, with whom you talked to and I just wanted to follow up on our conversation regarding the state song, ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME"" and its origin in hopes that your respective MARCHING BANDS and other entities who perform this song either instrumentally or vocally will strongly consider following up with performing ""LIFT EVERY VOICE"" afterwards written by J. ROSAMOND JOHNSON and JAMES WELDON JOHNSON.  The following post I wrote last month will hopefully shed light why I feel this compromise is important and timely given the KENTUCKY DERBY is within a few weeks and the fall football and basketball seasons will be upon us before we know it: After expressing my thoughts on the origin and inspiration of the KENTUCKY STATE SONG, ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME""...I have gotten a lot of positive feedback by enlightening those who were unaware of the TRUE history behind the song. STEPHEN FOSTER originally had it entitled, ""POOR UNCLE TOM, GOOD NIGHT"" in his sketchbook referring to a slave at FEDERAL HILL MANSION being sold by JUDGE JOHN ROWAN at an auction in Lexington, KY to pay off a debt and sent down river to a Louisiana sugar cane plantation...as his wife or some love interest weeped uncontrollably. But he changed it to ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME, GOOD NIGHT"" as not to make any of the patrons of the early minstrel shows at that time uncomfortable. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rowan_(Kentucky) But anyway, I took the opportunity to go visit FEDERAL HILL MANSION aka MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME and took pics that I will share... And also do an ENCORE presentation of my posting about the KENTUCKY STATE SONG. (A Posting from February 2019 Shortly After Visiting Federal Hill Mansion) May I be frank for a moment??? I have to cleanse my soul with this deeeeeep thought-provoking interwoven stir of conflict I have going on inside this temple... As we approach another DERBY EXTRAVAGANT CELEBRATION SEASON, my thoughts on the KENTUCKY STATE SONG, ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME"" gives me great pause given the original inspiration for the writing of these words by STEPHEN COLLINS FOSTER. Oh sure, it is called ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME"" and has been and is played by many college and high school bands, especially by the UNIVERSITY of KENTUCKY MARCHING and PEP BANDS at the end of each football and basketball games. It is also played by the UNIVERSITY of LOUISVILLE MARCHING BAND and sung by the crowd as the thoroughbred horses are led out of the paddock area heading to their posts at the starting gate. But the original lyrics that were found in Foster's sketch book offer a different view and was meant to be an anti-slavery sentiment based on a book published by Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1852 called, ""UNCLE TOM's CABIN"" and lamenting about the plight of a slave who was about to get sold at the LEXINGTON SLAVE AUCTION and shipped down river to one of LOUISIANA's sugar cane plantations to pay off a debt while staying at FEDERAL HILL FARM in Bardstown, Kentucky.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin So herein lies the dilemma. Whites will be getting all emotional and teary-eyed for a few minutes during that moment as the state's national anthem is played. Then shortly after that...the race begins...and the mint julips flow...THE KENTUCKY DERBY RACE IS OVER!!! WE HAVE A WINNER!!! BUT WAIT!!! WHAT ABOUT THE SONG??? The original name of it was, ""POOR UNCLE TOM, GOOD NIGHT!!!"" So as a Candidate for the U.S. SENATE RACE coming up in 2020 and the KENTUCKY DERBY coming up in a few months...I'm torn at the seams of what to do?!? Do I make waves and call for a ban of the song altogether due to the true tragic history and nature of the song??? Do I educate and simultaneously edutain folks in forcing a real dialogue on race relations in this state and country??? Because there was a reason the original name was changed and some of the lyrics were changed. What would the GREAT STATESMAN aka THE GREAT COMPROMISER SENATOR HENRY CLAY DO??? After careful prayer and thought, I came up with a potentially workable solution: Immediately after playing ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME""...start playing ""LIFT EVERY VOICE"" and have all the college and high school bands and choirs learn it. Then they can play and sing it at every UNIVERSITY of KENTUCKY, UNIVERSITY of LOUISVILLE, EASTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY, WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY and MURRAY STATE UNIVERSITY basketball and football games. And the crowd during THE POST PARADE can proudly sing ""MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME"" followed by ""LIFT EVERY VOICE"" and we can begin to FINALLY understand UNCLE TOM's situation and circumstances and FULLY REALIZE why his wife, lady or love interest....WEEPED UNCONTROLLABLY!!! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Old_Kentucky_Home https://youtu.be/FlvHj9w3ZTI https://www.google.com/search?q=LIFT+EVERY+VOICE&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-Address&ie=&oe=&safe=active&gws_rd=ssl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngFDy52eCZY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba41unjrrsE ************* So prayerfully, you can see my concern as an African-American candidate for the U.S. SENATE RACE and the thoughts of all African-Americans in general whenever the state song is performed and/or sung. So I pray you will communicate with whomever the decision makers are and implement this idea in honor, recognition and respect of all the former slaves (especially those who were sold and sent down the river like Tom), the black jockeys and trainers who rode in the first Kentucky Derbies and subsequent ones until their ouster, and our fellow African-American Kentuckians in general. Thank you for your time and I appreciate your attention to this very important matter. Humbly submitted, Bennie J. _______ Bennie J.

If your progressive ideals end because people in a region voted in a way you don't understand, then you're not really a progressive. You still view people as worthy only when they ""act right"" and that's not what progressivism is about. Do better. We don't get to act better than the rest of the state when there is a literal Ninth Street Divide and an entire area of town that has been neglected through public policy.

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-02-15 10:06:22,"U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE BENNIE J. SMITH (D-KY) DECLARES ""WAR ON POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS & THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ""KENTUCKY LIVES MATTER"" In an effort to aggressively address the plight of those Kentucky residents who are considered middle class, working poor, paycheck-to-paycheck, at or below the poverty level, plus those in transition dealing with homelessness...Smith wants to offer radical solutions to offset what he feels is an attack on THE COMMONWEALTH's most vulnerable. Toward those efforts, his TEAM ONE KENTUCKY campaign platform initiatives will include, but not limited to the following: 1. Raise the living wage to $15/hour so that citizens can contribute to the economy with additional funds to buy products and invest in services. The current minimum wage of $7.25/ hour is a disgrace and considered below survival wages. 2. Funding for FREE and REDUCED breakfast and lunch for kids at public schools who are in low income families. When kids don't get fuel for their bodies, their attention span is limited. 3. Funding for After School Programs to give kids activities to do in prevention of negative influences. 4. Funding for building more Community Centers and Sports Complexes in urban, rural and Appalachian areas that offer a a holistic approach to family oriented activities. This would add to the health and wellness while enhancing the quality of life of families, kids and seniors. Senior citizens need more quality of life activities for their extended life experiences. 5. Funding for Vocational Schools to provide alternate job skills training for students and adults not attending college or universities. However, opportunities will also be available for those expressing interest in attending an area Community College. When we have a highly skilled workforce with living wage skills, we not only retain our talent at home, but we will be able to be competitive regionally, nationally and globally. 6. Deschedule and Legalize Marijuana-Cannabis for medicinal and recreational use on a responsible and accountability basis.  7. Lure and create Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Technology Jobs to address climate change and address the harmful effects of fossil fuels and green gas emissions. We shall DEMAND cleaner air, cleaner water and restoration of the landscapes that have been damaged by strip top mining, etc. Therefore, we would heavily invest in solar panels and wind turbines to help replace the coal mine jobs in the rapidly declining coal industry. These workers could get trained, licensed and own their own businesses while renovating their respective communities that include housing, retrofitting old downtown businesses and re-establish sustainable economic growth with living wages. https://spectra.mhi.com/fastest-growing-energy-sources?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKrxBRDHARIsAKCzn8wbREQPIh0J2eSdbqxOS8Jfdytsb3u6HqEyJSW07RTOqyWT31fUP3saAuc9EALw_wcB 8. Implement Black History classes into all public schools curriculum. It's way past due that we address and correct history and finally dispel the ""myth"" that Black History started with slavery. In fact, ""slaves were not brought from Africa to America. People were brought from Kemet to be enslaved in America."" Once we correct the facts about Black History, all of society, especially Black kids, will be more confident and proud and will be encouraged to learn, grow and prosper. 9. Funding for more affordable housing for those citizens interested in home ownership that will be affordable within their respective income brackets. 10. Funding for the building of Hotels specifically targeted for the homeless modeled after Hotel Louisville, whereas, the facility would address and treat alcohol and drug addiction. It would also serve as a medical clinic and job training source to assist participants get back on their feet to become productive citizens. Their hotel stay would be temporary while they go through recovery and training. 11. Bring rapid and light rail passenger train services to The Commonwealth of Kentucky modeled after the LYNX (CATS) system based in Charlotte, NC. This service would offer local and regional transit to reconnect towns and cities throughout the state. This would also create jobs and jobs skills training necessary that would add to the state's bottom line. 12. Universal Health Care using a Single Payer System can be implemented into the Affordable Care Act aka OBAMACARE and be tweaked to the point of creating competition of health care providers across state lines. Our lives depend on being healthy. This is a RIGHT...not a PRIVILEGE!!! Specialized areas of healthcare would cover: *Sickle Cell Anemia * Autism *Blindness, Visual and Hearing Impairments *Various Physical Disabilities *Mental Health and Illness Other disabilities and impairments that would warrant health care and wellness services https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare These are a few samples that we feel would help improve the lives of our fellow Kentuckians in an effort to give them hope as well as retain students and workers within our wonderful state.

Smith (D-KY) U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE TEAM ONE KENTUCKY As we continue to squeeze BLACK HISTORY MONTH facts, tragedies, achievements, challenges, survivals, and obstacles into the shortest month of the year, we have primarily focused on our history from the perspective of AFRICANS and AFRICAN AMERICANS' history starting during slavery. But the FACT of the matter is BLACK HISTORY is not based on the narrative that ""slaves were brought from Africa to America to be slaves."" On the contrary, ""a civilized people were brought from KEMET to be enslaved in America."" The moment we ALL acknowledge that will make the difference between how we as BLACKS reflect within ourselves that we are actually the descendants of KINGS and QUEENS rather than the descendants of slaves. The deliberate FAILURE of our public and private schools and the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION has whitewashed our history in justifying the superiority-inferiority dynamic that has been prevelant in the entrenched policies and systemic institutional racism that has been allowed to exist for control and dependency in the AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. This is why one of my platform initiatives calls for implementing Black History into the curriculum in order to uplift and energize our students to want to excel. And to recognize Black students learn different and the current methods of teaching are setting the majority up to fail.  So with all that being said, WE must also recruit and retain more Black teachers, with an emphasis on Black males, so our youth can have a fair chance to succeed in an effort to close the achievement gap. Case in point is a book by Mr. RICKIE CLARK that every household and schools should have, particularly Black households, called ""KINDERGARTEN TO 12TH GRADE CAN = 13 YEARS A SLAVE."" This book explores the following: *Educate Me About What? *Are We Free-Dumb? *Did Integration Work? *The Mis-Education of the No-Grow *To Give Back or Go Back *""N"" Are Only Made In America *The Equity Walk https://www.amazon.com/Kindergarten-12th-Grade-Years-Slave/dp/1092523022 Mr. Clark's unique and energetic approach to working with youth, particularly young men of color, has proven successful through his STRATEGIES TO ELEVATE PEOPLE (STEP) program, assisting more than 1,500 youth to either complete high school, obtain a GED or go on to college. www.rickieclark.com The bottom line is if a people don't know where they came from, they don't know where they're going. So I just wanted to express my thoughts on elevating our collective minds (Blacks, Whites, Latinos, Hispanics, Asians) and send out a clarion call to action that will give our kids better opportunities than we had.

Upper Street Lexington, KY 40507 https://sharethelex.com/articles_and_guides/underground-railroad-stop/#filter=.articles-list__scroller-item-page-1 Today we are thankful for RICHARD ALLEN, Founder and Organizer of the AME Church. Richard Allen (February 14, 1760 – March 26, 1831) was a minister, educator, writer, and one of America's most active and influential black leaders.  In 1794 he founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent black denomination in the United States. He opened his first AME church in 1794 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Elected the first bishop of the AME Church in 1816, Rev. Allen focused on organizing a denomination where free blacks could worship without racial oppression and where slaves could find a measure of dignity.  He worked to upgrade the social status of the black community, organizing Sabbath schools to teach literacy and promoting national organizations to develop political strategies. https://www.spame.org/ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Allen_(bishop) SAAAAAAA-LUTE!!!",,,,,,,,,630464287521761,/story.php?story_fbid=630464287521761&id=396578117577047

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-02-05 07:13:28,"HAPPY HUMP DAY FAMILY!!! Praying your week has been fun, safe and productive thus far. You know, since posting that message yesterday about GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS entering the State Capitol with their semi-automatic weapons,  camouflage gear and masks, I've gotten a few comments and some pushback along with being called a few names within the posting as well as my inbox. But as I emphasized to each respondent, I care more about GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION more than anything while protecting our citizens and kids with Gun Safety Locks. I also mentioned about their attempts of intimidation with those tactics that reminded me of Domestic and Foreign Terrorists. That definitely hit a nerve. But the bottom line is that they were so focused on thinking someone wants to take their gun rights or guns away from them that they missed the whole message.  Needless to say that after mentioning their tactics reminded me of terrorists, one gentleman responded with the following statement as well as the attached... ""ONE MAN'S TERRORIST IS ANOTHER MAN'S FREEDOM FIGHTER"" So I will continue with my message of GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION to advance and promote the safety of our citizens and our kids. If we can do something about gun violence in our urban areas, that would be great too!!! In summary, I am a STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE 2nd AMENDMENT...NOT THE NRA!!!",3,2,,,1,,,,627939274440929,/story.php?story_fbid=627939274440929&id=396578117577047
Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-02-04 13:00:33,"WHY was this allowed to happen??? These GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS feel that their 2nd Amendment Rights are under attack when most U.S. citizens, including myself, only want to ensure that common sense gun safety legislation can be enacted like Universal Background Checks (We don't want criminals being able to buy weapons) for law-abiding citizens, Gun Safety Locks for households with kids 16 and under because we've seen too many accidental shootings when kids got ahold of unsecure guns, and a ban on the sale of military-style semi-automatic weapons. Not sure what or who you're trying to hunt with these weapons.  If you do own these weapons, registering them would assure the safety for our law enforcement officers and the public-at-large. But NOBODY said anything about confiscating weapons or infringing upon anyone's 2nd Amendment Rights. That's an NRA sound bite! But GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION is key to ensuring public safety as well as safety in the home. Where was DANIEL CAMERON when these activists entered the Capitol bypassing the metal detectors. If they had been Black, all HELL would've broken loose!!! https://amp-courier--journal-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.courier-journal.com/amp/2858260001?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D#aoh=15808390928057&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.courier-journal.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2020%2F01%2F31%2Fkentucky-gun-rights-rally-calls-protecting-second-amendment%2F2858260001%2F ***THIS WAS AKIN TO A THREAT***",2,1,,,,,1,2,627407607827429,/story.php?story_fbid=627407607827429&id=396578117577047

We would either have 24 hotels built to accommodate a 5-county radius or 40 hotels built to accommodate a 3-county radius within our 120 Kentucky counties.

Funding for building more Community Centers and Sports Complexes in urban, rural and Appalachian areas that offer a a holistic approach to family oriented activities. This would add to the health and wellness while enhancing the quality of life of families, kids and seniors. Senior citizens need more quality of life activities for their extended life experiences. 4. Funding for Vocational Schools to provide alternate job skills training for students not attending college or universities. However, opportunities will be available for those expressing interest in attending an area Community College. 5. Funding for Job Skills Training to enhance the Commonwealth of Kentucky's current and future workforce in order for them to be competitive regionally, nationally and globally. 6. Lure and create Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Technology Jobs to address climate change and address the harmful effects of fossil fuels and green gas emissions. We shall DEMAND cleaner air, cleaner water and restoration of the landscapes that have been damaged by strip top mining, etc. Therefore, we would heavily invest in solar panels and wind turbines to help replace the coal mine jobs in the rapidly declining coal industry. These workers could get trained, licensed and own their own businesses while renovating their respective communities that include housing, retrofitting old downtown businesses and re-establish sustainable economic growth with living wages. https://spectra.mhi.com/fastest-growing-energy-sources?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKrxBRDHARIsAKCzn8wbREQPIh0J2eSdbqxOS8Jfdytsb3u6HqEyJSW07RTOqyWT31fUP3saAuc9EALw_wcB 7. Implement Black History classes into all public schools curriculum. It's way past due that we address and correct history and finally dispel the ""myth"" that Black History started with slavery. In fact, ""slaves were not brought from Africa to America. People were brought from Kemet to be enslaved in America."" Once we correct the facts about Black History, all of society, especially Black kids, will be more confident and proud and will be encouraged to learn, grow and prosper. 8. Funding for more affordable housing for those citizens interested in home ownership that will be affordable within their respective income brackets. 9. Funding for the building of Hotels specifically targeted for the homeless modeled after Hotel Louisville, whereas, the facility would address and treat alcohol and drug addiction. It would also serve as a medical clinic and job training source to assist participants get back on their feet to become productive citizens. Their hotel stay would be temporary while they go through recovery and training. 10. Bring rapid and light rail passenger train services to The Commonwealth of Kentucky modeled after the LYNX (CATS) system based in Charlotte, NC. This service would offer local and regional transit to reconnect towns and cities throughout the state. This would also create jobs and jobs skills training necessary that would add to the state's bottom line. 11. Universal Health Care using a Single Payer System can be implemented into the Affordable Care Act aka OBAMACARE and be tweaked to the point of creating competition of health care providers across state lines. Our lives depend on being healthy. This is a RIGHT...not a PRIVILEGE!!! Specialized areas of healthcare would cover: *Sickle Cell Anemia * Autism *Blindness, Visual and Hearing Impairments *Various Physical Disabilities *Mental Health and Illness Other disabilities and impairments that would warrant health care and wellness services https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare These are a few samples that we feel would help improve the lives of our fellow Kentuckians in an effort to give them hope as well as retain students and workers within our wonderful state.

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-01-21 12:30:30,"Bennie J. Smith is running for U.S. SENATOR 2020 (D-KY) as a change agent to repair the damage ADDISON MITCHELL McCONNELL aka ""MOSCOW MITCH"" and ""THE GRIM REAPER"" has caused. He also wants to offer the citizens in the Commonwealth of Kentucky a more positive and upbeat representative who has all their best interests at heart. At an early age growing up in the housing projects of Charlotte Court on the west side of Lexington, Kentucky, Bennie J. knew he wanted to do and be something more. He experienced a two-parent setting until he was 10 year old, whereas, his parents separated and divorced. The family then moved to Danville and as a way to address his aggressions, he learned to play the alto saxophone in the 5th grade at Toliver Elementary School. He credits music as being lifesaving. He drew inspiration from his visually impaired mother as she raised 4 kids to adulthood while on public assistance and food stamps. She also sacrificed a portion of her SSI check to make monthly payments on a horn rental while he was in the 5th through 7th grades to ensure he had an instrument to practice and play on. So he credits his mother for instilling compassion while overcoming any and all life obstacles and credits his father for instilling the work ethic he so passionately attained. He also credits summer camps (YMCA CAMP DANIEL BOONE and TROOPER ISLAND) and the association of mentors from Big Brothers/Big Sisters as other lifechanging experiences. As the eldest of four, he was always the adventurous one as he met no strangers during his life's journey. Bennie J. is a 1976 graduate of Lafayette High School and earned college credit hours after attending Kentucky State University and Eastern Kentucky University. He hopes his work as a civil and human rights activist as well as his roles as a parent and grandparent will give him an edge in being more empathetic to other people's needs and concerns as well as gain the support of Kentucky voters.

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-01-18 04:05:11,"That time 7 years ago when I defended Actress ASHLEY JUDD and requested MITCH McCONNELL apologize for laughing at her for disclosing her experience with depression: *****Published April 13, 2013***** SMITH CALLS ON SENATOR McCONNELL TO APOLOGIZE TO ASHLEY JUDD Says She Is The One Affected By His Aides' Campaign Target Research Rather Than Watterson-Gate 'Bugging' Louisville, KY - U.S. Senate candidate Bennie J. Smith shares that he has suffered from DEPRESSION on several occasions during his adult life and knows firsthand the devastating effects the disease can cause if it doesn't get treated timely and properly. He said he looked forward to a debate with Mr. Addison Mitchell McConnell on health care issues relating to depression and other hot button issues. McConnell's aides were heard laughing in the background after actress Ashley Judd's mental health was discussed in a manner as to run campaign ads against her. McConnell himself has cried ""foul"" since he felt infringed upon by a Watergate-type bugging system at his headquarters in Louisville on February 2 during a campaign strategy meeting. He has since requested the FBI to launch an investigation into who and how the eavesdropping operation took place and vowed to press criminal charges. On the audio, McConnell, the U.S. Senate minority leader, remains silent as his campaign aides reveal research they have conducted on potential Republican and Democratic opponents. They laughed at remarks that actress and potential opponent Ashley Judd made in an interview about how depression affected her. Later, at a news conference at which he addressed the recording that was given to Mother Jones magazine by an unnamed source, he offered no apology for the direction his campaign aides were mapping out, but instead, McConnell came up with a vast left-wing conspiracy involving listening devices that he said were reflective of what his fellow Republican, Richard Nixon, had employed against Democrats.  On the recording, an aide can be heard talking about the wealth of information in the public domain about Judd’s struggles with depression. “She’s clearly, this sounds extreme, but she is emotionally unbalanced,” he said. Then laughter can be heard as he plays a recording of Judd discussing her behavior before she received treatment. Using a person’s mental illness for your advantage “makes you look bad, small and unintelligent,” said Kelli Gunning, operations director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness in Lexington. One in four people experiences mental illness in their lifetime, and depression is the most common disorder, caused by a variety of reasons, Gunning said. “It doesn’t have anything to do with anyone’s stability,” she said. We all should praise Judd for being courageous enough to write a book about her struggles and for being so open about it. “She is addressing it and is aware of it,” Gunning said. “She is not in the closet. All power to her for coming out and talking about it and opening up so other people who are suffering won’t feel alone.” Judd has talked about a visit she made in 2006 to the Shades of Hope Treatment Center in Buffalo Gap, Texas, to visit her sister, singer Wynonna, who was being treated for an eating disorder. While there, the counselors noticed how affected Judd was by her sister’s revelations. They approached her and suggested that she seek help as well. In an interview with Glamour Magazine, Ashley Judd said she was treated for “co-dependence in my relationships; depression; blaming, raging, numbing, denying and minimizing my feelings. But because my addictions were behavioral, not chemical, I wouldn’t have known to seek treatment. At Shades of Hope, my behaviors were treated like addictions. And those behaviors were killing me spiritually, the same as someone who is sitting on a corner with a bottle in a brown paper bag.” The stigma of mental illness won’t go away until we put that illness in the same category as diabetes or cancer, Gunning said.  McConnell should come out and say, “‘How can I help you,’” Gunning said. “‘What can I do to make this a health issue? Gee, Ashley, how can we improve our mental health issues?’” In a statement, Judd’s spokeswoman, Cara Tripicchio, said, “This is yet another example of the politics of personal destruction that embody Mitch McConnell and are pervasive in Washington, D.C. We expected nothing less from Mitch McConnell and his camp to take a personal struggle such as depression, which many Americans cope with on a daily basis, and turn it into a laughing matter.” Because McConnell’s campaign was so willing to use depression to his advantage, Gunning said, too many viable political candidates might turn away out of fear of being ostracized.  Smith (D-KY), thinks that Senator Addison McConnell should apologize to Ashley Judd. ""It appears Mr. McConnell is attempting to prop himself up as the 'victim' with the disclosure of the comments that were made at their campaign meeting. However, in my humble opinion, I feel Miss Judd has been disrespected with their alleged plans to make her mental health one of the central issues against her in his campaign. Therefore, he should do the right thing and offer her a sincere apology,"" Smith said.  At press time, it has since been learned that a few operatives with PROGRESSIVE KENTUCKY, a grassroots organization, may have been responsible for eavesdropping outside the door of the meeting.

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-01-15 12:25:15,"The Republican Party Has Become One of Zombies and Idiots by RICHARD ROMINE It is truly sad to see what the “Greed and Purity” virus has done to the Republican Party. Some have become zombies, with a blank face spouting the SocioCon and Supremacist message. Blindly repeating the same words sometimes in unison and always making sure they look like a righteous idiot as they do so. Then you have the idiots, blindly reacting with rage to anything they don’t want to hear. Telling others that solar farms suck up the sun and windmills cause cancer. They remind me of a scene from Family Feud, the local stations were playing recently. The question asked was “What food is Popeye the Sailor most associated with?” Her answer was “Chicken!” and she began to dance in triumph. Of course the correct answer was spinach, as in the Popeye cartoons. Their obsession with always “Winning” make them stupid. They are so very sure they are right about everything, that the truth really doesn’t matter. Only the perceived victory for their ideology. I remember a Republican Party of honor. I may not have agreed with them, but I respected them. Now as I look as to the havoc they have unleashed upon our nation. I have no respect for the shells of human being they have become. Ones that cannot speak out when things are wrong if the party says it what is right. It’s much like the scene in 1984. If the party says 2+2=5, then beyond human logic, truth and ethics, it will be 5. That is the Republican Party of today. Where truth has long ago, gone to die. Where logic is relative to message and ethics are for losers. To see what a zombie truly looks like, look at Lindsey Graham, or Rick Scott or any number of their fellow “Brain Eaters.” Because the Republican Party has become that of the “Brain Eaters.” They must eat your brain if you are to become a member. For all of the many flaws of our political system, the Republican Party stands out, as the party that ate the brains of so many in America.

Whereas, they would sell for $12k, they have to eat that rather than charging $15,000.00 per unit. EXHIBIT B - Steel Companies have had to lay off workers, cut shifts and close some factories due to the TARIFFS affecting their production. More products than demand. EXHIBIT C - Corporate Run Farms (CRF) are reaping benefits more than Family Run Farms (FRF) and creating hardships for the FRF's and causing some to be at the brink of shutting down for lack of funds available to purchase equipment nor have to ability to sell what they grow, etc. Therefore, 45 is and has been LYING when he says CHINA is paying for the TARIFFS when, in fact, AMERICANS and AMERICAN BUSINESSES have been paying a costly price!!! https://www.npr.org/2019/12/06/785280703/how-hard-are-tariffs-hitting-the-economy-it-depends-on -who-you-ask ""THE TRUTH SHALL SET US ALL FREE!!!""",3,1,,,1,,1,,615359735698883,/story.php?story_fbid=615359735698883&id=396578117577047

Smith (D-KY) has ""officially"" filed to be on the ballot during the May 19, 2020 Primary Election. Smith is a Danville-Lexington native currently residing in Louisville. He is the eldest of 4 and has 1 son, 3 grandkids and 3 granddogs. He is a 1976 graduate of Lafayette High School and attended Kentucky State University, Eastern Kentucky University and was the first male graduate of Lexington Urban League Word Processing Training Program. He is a Professional Driver holding a CDL CLASS A License. He's also a musician, promoter and event planner. He first dabbled in politics in 1996 as a Precinct Captain for the ELEANOR JORDAN for CONGRESS campaign in the Newburg Community. He then ran for Mayor of Louisville as an Independent in 1998.  From 1996 through 2002, Smith became an advocate for social justice as a civil and human rights activist with the KENTUCKY ALLIANCE AGAINST RACIST & POLITICAL REPRESSION and FELLOWSHIP of RECONCILIATION. He was on the front lines with Rev. Louis Coleman, Anne Braden, Mattie Jones, Bob Cunningham, Willie Gray, Tom Moffett, George and Jean Edwards. From January through November 2008, he volunteered with ORGANIZING for AMERICA (NC) for the OBAMA-BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL campaign after relocating to Charlotte, NC. He also volunteered as an Administrative Assistant for the MECKLENBURG COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY from June through November 2008. Family issues caused him to return to Lexington, KY in April 2009 and shortly upon his return, he worked simultaneously on the BEN CHANDLER and JACK CONWAY campaigns while volunteering with the FAYETTE COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY. Smith got hired as a Field Organizer for the OHIO DEMOCRATIC PARTY in 2012 and worked with the OBAMA-BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL RE-ELECTION campaign as part of ORGANIZING for AMERICA (OH). Finally, Bennie J. tossed his hat back into the political arena in March 2013 as a candidate for the 2014 U.S. Senate race. However, he suspended his campaign after 6 months when the KENTUCKY DEMOCRATIC PARTY tapped Alison Lundergan Grimes as its nominee. Bennie J.'s sister, Bonita C. Smith, was present to offer family support. He also ran into his KSU classmate, KY State Rep Derrick Graham (D-KY). benniejsmith.com https://ballotpedia.org/Bennie_Smith",,,,,,,,,610559669512223,/story.php?story_fbid=610559669512223&id=396578117577047

Bennie J. Smith D-KY 4 US Senator 2020,,2020-01-06 10:07:33,"WHY AM I RUNNING??? by Bennie J. Smith * I was inspired to run for U.S. Senator for the 2nd time due to being frustrated after last year's Government Shutdown. * Several persons inspire me in the political and leadership arena: President Barack Obama First Lady Michelle Obama Senator Wendell Ford House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Senator John McCain George Fraser Senator Sherrod Brown  Malcolm Nance General Colin Powell General Barry McCaffrey I admire each of them for their courage, integrity, service and commitment to country and its citizens. * I'm currently 1 of 7 declared candidates for U.S. Senator (D-KY) and I'm running to represent the underserved, middle class and the voiceless as well as the working poor. * I am also running so my grandkids, nieces and great nieces have better conditions for when they get ready to enter the work force or be of service to their respective communities. * Some of the events that impacted my decision to run for office was seeing the plight of some of my family members, friends and other fellow citizens who were going through some rough times. Plus my own experiences with certain employers and conditions created a fire inside my belly to want to do something to make things better. * I was also affected by the situation of poor Blacks, Whites, Latinos, Immigrants and Refugees in the urban, rural and Appalachian sectors.

His name is BILL COLEMAN and he was a jazz trumpet player who started out learning to play the clarinet and C-Melody Saxophone before settling on the trumpet. He played in Cincinnati and eventually moved to New York to perform and record with many jazz greats from the 30's thru the 40's. CAFE SOCIETY JAZZ CLUB was located at Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village and was the first racially integrated nightclub in the United States. Coleman as well as other African American musicians and vocalists performed there regularly. Due to racial segregation, Mr. COLEMAN eventually moved to Paris, France in 1948 because he was well received there than on American soil as many other Black performers experienced during that period.  So please allow me to share this information and if anyone knows if Mr. COLEMAN has any surviving relatives in Paris, KY or anywhere else, please feel free to share.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Coleman",,,,,,,,,603954930172697,/story.php?story_fbid=603954930172697&id=396578117577047

The questions that needs immediate answers to are: 1. Was there IMMINENT DANGER and THREAT to Americans and American Interests? 2. Where is the EVIDENCE??? 3. Why wasn't there an effort to get CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL for this action??? I don't believe 45 thought out the repercussions of such a high risk operation against the #2 Iranian Official. But I do believe some sort of retaliation will take place against Americans and other American allies.

As this race heats up, I'm gonna have to mention that I respect Amy McGrath and her service to the country as a fighter jet pilot. But when you can't win your own county in a previous election cycle, then that tells me you're pretty much using your military service and an unanswered letter to MOSCOW MITCH as a ""pass"" to make voters in Kentucky believe you have the ""right stuff"" to deliver and represent ALL Kentuckians. But when you veered off the runway in your initial campaign ""launch"" and expressed favoritism to TRUMP while at the same time shared that you didn't see anything that would've disqualified BRETT KAVANAUGH from being confirmed to the Supreme Court after disturbing testimony at his confirmation hearing...then backtracked when angry donors balked...that showed me at that very moment in the span of a few days you were a panderer and a flip-flopper. Kentucky needs strong, bold leadership who says what they mean and mean what they say firmly and who will work hard on behalf of ALL Kentuckians regardless of political affiliation. As 1 of 5 currently declared candidates who established TEAM ONE KENTUCKY, I intend to file paperwork to get on the ballot no later than Friday January 17.
