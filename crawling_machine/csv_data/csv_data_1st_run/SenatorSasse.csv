Senator Ben Sasse,,2019-06-20 16:29:33,"Slandering pro-life Americans as, in effect, Klan members and Nazis is a way of crushing debate.

What you will find are people who passionately are devoted to the dignity to every human being, no matter how small, no matter how small or how vulnerable or what disease they might have been diagnosed with. You will find a lot of Americans, young and old in the Pro-Life movement, who care deeply about women who are in need. You will find a lot of enthusiasm for the promising in vitro surgeries and for scientific developments in ultrasound and neonatal technology.

Bridges and roads are mangled or gone completely. Entire communities are underwater. Homes are destroyed. Businesses and schools shut down indefinitely. Livestock remain in danger. And, most tragically, a few families mourn the loss of a loved one. The grief is profound. But this is Nebraska. Our people are tough and resilient. Among these stories of overwhelming loss are stories of powerful love of neighbor. Volunteers flocking to serve meals at the shelters. Entire families heading out to fill sandbags. Neighbors showing up with hay for animals in desperate need. Local pilots flying people and supplies in and out of communities cut off by the water. First responders serving their communities tirelessly without rest. (The word “hero “ gets used an awful lot these days. In this case it seems like the right fit.) There is a long recovery ahead, and the weeks and months to come will no doubt bring new hardships and fresh challenges. But this is Nebraska. Our communities are pulling together.
