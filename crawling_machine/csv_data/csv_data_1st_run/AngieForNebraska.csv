We had a great #TeamAngie turn out complete with Angie for US Senate T-shirts, rally signs, and stickers.

It feels good to represent my home. If feels good to make my dad and the community that raised meÔøº proud. Even if we don‚Äôt always see eye to eye.

Angie For Senate,,2020-02-26 14:39:15,"Today #TeamAngie is handling things so I can have a day of self care and to re-energize and spend time with my family. And I am so thankful for them.  When I began speaking with people about my run for U.S. Senate, they told me ‚Äúno one will take you seriously until you have a million dollars‚Äù. Many peoples first piece of advice was for me to start fundraising to pay staff.  Despite this advice, I‚Äôve always known two things. One- we will not out fundraise the millionaire Senator, we have to outwork him instead. And two- to win a statewide election, we will need a movement of the people because while elections do require money, it is people who vote.  After months of hard work and endless outreach efforts, I am now almost fully ‚Äústaffed‚Äù with a team of volunteers that range from professional backgrounds to experienced volunteers and newcomers. They come from various backgrounds, and they all have a commitment to sharing our message and gaining representation for all Nebraskan‚Äôs- regardless of what letter we have behind our names, which also varies.  I‚Äôm proud of the team we have and the movement we are building.

Angie For Senate,,2020-02-22 01:29:36,"One of my first out of town trips to speak with Nebraskan‚Äôs was attending a Santee Sioux Tribal Council meeting. A friend I had worked with in organizing humanitarian aid to families impacted by the O‚ÄôNeill ICE raids had helped me connect with the council‚Äôs Vice Chairman who kindly invited me to be his guest. I was absolutely blown away by how much work they are doing in their community with such limited resources.  Today I had the opportunity to join the Nebraska Inter Tribal Coalition conference. The coalition includes council from the Omaha, Ponca, Santee Sioux, and Winnebago tribes of Nebraska. They spoke about the great things happening in their communities as well as the struggles they are facing.  When you attend these meetings it is very clear that everyone in the room has a deep concern and love for their community. It isn‚Äôt about power or ego or politics. It‚Äôs just about taking care of their people. It is truly admirable and I am so thankful for the opportunity to learn from them.  #AngieForNebraska #NebraskaForEveryone",23,11,,12,,,,1,3074155079275060,/story.php?story_fbid=3074155079275060&id=2161190787238165

Having been raised in a rural community, I understand the constant fear of rural decay, the need for equal access to resources and opportunities, and the frustration when folks who‚Äôve never experienced rural Nebraska life decide they know how to best help.  You know who‚Äôs going to develop the best rural policy? Rural Nebraska. It‚Äôs a mistake to think what works in the city or in one rural area will work in every rural area. Rather, we must speak with rural communities and learn not only their barriers, but their strengths. We must uplift the good work they are doing and develop policy that supports it. And that policy must allow for the flexibility for each town to develop a unique path to revitalizing their communities.

I‚Äôm a lifelong Nebraskan, born and raised in western rural Nebraska. My dad, my in laws, and my moms family still live out west. I use to supervise casework from Sutherland to Scottsbluff. I know where the working class are out west, what they‚Äôre concerned about, and how to connect with them. I am them. They raised me. I currently reside in Omaha and have grassroots ties to our urban communities. I can GOTV across the state.  2. You can see the voluntary grassroots work I‚Äôve done in our community. I‚Äôm not making empty promises. I have work to back up my words.  3. Working class and impoverished people deserve representation in our government. I can provide that.  4. I‚Äôm authentic. You know where I stand yet I‚Äôm open for discussion. I care more about getting it right than ‚Äúbeing‚Äù right. If you have concerns about my policy, I‚Äôm open to suggestions. The more voices included, the better the policy will be.  5. One thing about being a part of the working poor my whole life is it‚Äôs taught me that money isn‚Äôt everything. The well being of my friends, family, and country doesn‚Äôt have a price tag‚Äî I can‚Äôt be bought.

It‚Äôs an economic system and it‚Äôs led us to income inequality and oppression of marginalized communities and the working class.

We can implement socialist policies and place checks and balances on capitalism without giving up our republic democracy. In fact we already have. See roads, public education, fire and police departments, and social security.  The idea that implementing a single payer system for healthcare, expanding free public education, increased taxes on the ultra-wealthy, and refusal to treat corporations as people will lead us to our demise or stop us from being a democracy is a scare tactic used by the elitists hoarding the money to the top.  However, if we truly want to keep our democracy, we must address the corruption within our Republic, which has been manipulated to be ruled by elitists and big money interests.

Case in point- Senator Ben Sasse, who hasn‚Äôt held a town hall in ....so long no one remembers...and who asked police to eject a woman who had questions for him from the football game last week when he showed up to sell Runzas at the Husker game. Now a Sasse constituent has sent pictures of Sasse‚Äôs Lincoln office.  Not only was the constituent NOT buzzed in, Sasse's staff would only talk to her through a new intercom and passed papers under the solid wood door, denying the constituent the opportunity to speak to someone face to face.   We know earlier this year constituents delivered letters to the governor‚Äôs office, and the Governor's office staff was caught (on video) throwing those letters into the trash. If constituents are being denied access to Sasse's office, why should we believe Sasse's staff isn't doing the very same thing?

"Angie For Senate,Jessica Knurick, PhD, RD","Jessica Knurick, PhD, RD",2019-08-29 19:23:20,"Earlier today I was chatting with one of my best friends who lives in Finland. We are both pregnant with our first babies. It‚Äôs an exciting time and I‚Äôm so happy to be able to share in the experience with her. But in my conversation with her this morning, it became very clear that there is one thing that we will both experience very differently.  Maternity Leave.  You see‚Ä¶in our conversation she casually mentioned to me that she gets ‚Äúabout a year‚Äù of paid maternity leave. That is a full year that she gets to spend with her baby, full time. To bond, experience all of the firsts, and maximize the health of both mother and baby for years to come. There are 195 countries in the world. 190 offer paid maternity leave after childbirth. 5 do not. These include Lesotho, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, Swaziland, and the United States of America.  Incredible isn‚Äôt it?  For a country that prides itself on ‚Äúfamily values,‚Äù the United States does a remarkably terrible job of supporting mothers and families at an incredibly vulnerable time when they need help the most. In this country, only 12% of women are granted any kind of paid leave by their employers. And horrifyingly, 1 in 4 women are financially forced to go back to work within just 2 weeks of delivery, before their baby can even support his/her head properly. American mothers are routinely forced to leave their babies long before either of them are physically or emotionally ready to be separated. It takes a woman approximately 40 weeks to grow a baby, during which time she experiences extreme fatigue, nausea, headaches, cramping, muscle soreness, heartburn, shortness of breath, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids ‚Äì just to name a few. And she gets through this all the while working full time, often at a physically demanding and exhausting job. And that does not even touch on the incredible physical act that is childbirth itself. Women need maternity leave to not only care for their babies, but also to recover. To recover from both the physiological and psychological aspects that accompany the postpartum period, which include depression, lactation issues including mastitis, fatigue, and pain. Studies routinely show that parental leave can have a significant positive effect on the health of babies and mothers. In fact, paid parental leave can reduce infant mortality by as much as 10%. It also has been shown to increase the likelihood of infant doctor visits and vaccinations. And it increases the rate and duration of breastfeeding, which has a number of benefits for baby, including decreased rates of infection and SIDS, and lower risk for asthma and obesity later in life.  And there are benefits for mothers too. Paid maternity leave leads to lower rates of depression and improvement in overall mental health in the months and years that follow. But this is not just a moral and health-based argument. There are economic benefits to paid leave as well.  Researchers have routinely indicated that paid leave benefits women economically because they tend to go back to work and stay with the same employer, which means their wages grow at a faster rate afterward. Paid maternity leave is also associated with better job performance and retention among mothers, increased family incomes, and increased economic growth. These might be some of the reasons that literally every other industrialized country in the world offers working mothers paid maternity leave ‚Äì some offering more than a full year of paid leave.  It‚Äôs unfortunate to me that in this country, we look at women having children as a personal decision, which should only be made if one can handle the financial burden. Especially when 40% of all Americans are having a hard time earning enough to pay for rent, food, healthcare, and transportation costs, and 62% of Americans do not fall into the category of middle class. The ability to have a family, like so many things in this country, should not and must not be available only to the wealthy or those who have the means to do so.  Rather than an individual or personal decision, other countries view having children as a need to collectively grow the next generation, from which all individuals stand to benefit.  I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones. While I do not get any paid maternity leave, I do get 6 weeks partially paid short-term disability and have enough savings to get me through another 6 weeks. But really? Should we be in a situation, as the richest country in the world, where this is considered lucky? Should I be in routine conversations with working women who literally do not know how they are going to afford to take even 1-2 months off from work after the birth of their child? And should the United States of America continue to stay in the company of Lesotho, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, and Swaziland, as 190 other countries around the world do more to support their working mothers and families?  The answer has to be no. We must do better.

Angie For Senate,,2019-08-24 17:32:24,"Updated Bio!  Angie Philips (She/Her/Hers) is a lifelong Nebraskan. She grew up in rural western Nebraska before moving to Eastern Nebraska in 2002 where she currently resides in Omaha with her husband and three children. Angie studied Behavioral Science at Bellevue University and spent over a decade working in advocacy roles for at-risk youth and families. After having her 3rd child, Angie spent time at home caring for her children before returning to work at her brother's small family business. This allowed Angie the freedom to focus on her passions; community organizing and humanitarian aid.  Angie believes in the power of the people and has assisted with the organization of several acts of protest including the Women‚Äôs March on Omaha 2017, Omaha Women‚Äôs March 2018, Omaha Women‚Äôs Day March 2019, Stop the Ban Rally, and Lights for Liberty Omaha. As a Humanist, Angie is devoted to human welfare and believes that we all hold a personal responsibility to lead ethical lives that contribute to the greater good. She has assisted in the development of several grassroots organizations that help raise awareness and organize action as well as organized humanitarian aid such as relief for immigrant families impacted by the O‚ÄôNeill ICE Raids. Angie calls for the abolishment of ICE and has promised to make humane immigration reform one of her top priorities as a United States Senator.     In October 2018, at the suggestion of former State Senator Tanya Cook, Angie founded the Nebraska Progressive Legislative Study Group. LSG is a grassroots group which aims to educate Nebraskans about the Unicameral, encourages participation in helping progressives get elected, and follows and advocates for progressive state legislation. LSG membership recently advocated and testified for several bills including bills which would have provided protections for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community and legislation addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.    Angie also founded and chairs the Douglas County Democratic Party Women‚Äôs Caucus with a mission to ‚Äúempower women of all ages, advocate for women‚Äôs rights, educate on women‚Äôs issues, work towards equitable representation of women in leadership both inside and outside of government, and grow the Democratic party.‚Äù In full agreement with the platform of the WC, Angie views human rights as inseparable and diversity as inherently intersectional. She acknowledges the ways in which identities operate within systems of power, privilege, and oppression and condemns the additional burdens of discrimination placed on people in marginalized or underrepresented communities.         As the mother of a teenager and two young children, Angie worries about the direction our country is headed. She worries about the rise of white supremacy and the society and environment we are leaving for future generations. She is ready to take her organizational and advocacy skills to D.C. to push forward policies that improve the lives of everyday Nebraskans and work to save our democracy from the hands of the rising plutocracy that is failing the American people and preventing us from taking action on issues like gun control, healthcare, immigration, climate change, and public education.  Angie believes that together we can make a Nebraska for everyone, and a country our children can be proud of.  Today we build a movement, in 2020 we take the Senate!

Angie For Senate,,2019-07-28 11:46:43,"From the very beginning of my campaign, I wanted to ensure that folks knew I was ready to represent the entire state. Even if we disagree on policy, I can still care about your well being.  I want to work to heal the rural and urban divide. Not only because I love both the rural community that raised me and the urban city I now call home, but also because I realize how our success is intertwined. We succeed together, we fail together.  When I worked with local artist #Elspeth to create my logo we discussed how I wanted to show a United and flourishing Nebraska in the artwork. I asked them to incorporate images representative of all of Nebraska. There were a few things I asked for specifically.  1. The windmills that my dad spent years drilling and working on. He used to take us out with him sometimes. These moments are some of my BEST childhood memories. We got to help drive the pick up through gates, moo at the cows, and drink fresh water from the wells.  2. The Ogallala water tower. This tower has aliens painted on it and it lights up at night, like a UFO. My grandmother use to joke with us kids that if we weren‚Äôt asleep when it lit up the aliens would come get us lol.  3. Historical representation of Grant, my home town. This is the historical building off the main road in town. The street I walked up and down a million times.  4. The wind turbines. To represent how Nebraska loves the land that hosts us and how we will lead in clean energy.  5. Corn to represent pride in our agriculture.  6. (This was Elspeth‚Äôs idea) The line creating the horizon is I-80. The road that connects us.  What else do you recognize in the logo?

"Angie For Senate,Helping Kids Rise",Helping Kids Rise,2019-06-19 09:40:05,"Happy Juneteenth!On Juneteenth (June 19) we celebrate the freedom of all enslaved Black people. Although the Emancipation Proclamation declared freedom for enslaved people on January 1863, Texas did not acknowledge it until June 19, 1865.  Celebrate Juneteenth by: 1. Remembering those enslaved in America 2. Sharing their stories with young people 3. Continuing to work towards uplifting the communities that still feel the negative financial, educational, and emotional impact of slavery.  Sadly, Juneteenth is not a national holiday, but Texas did declare it an official state holiday in 1980, and 44 other states, as well as the District of Columbia, observe it. ""We're in denial of the African holocaust. Most times, people don't want to talk about it. One is often restless or termed a racist just for having compassion for the African experience, for speaking truth to the trans-Atlantic and Arab slave trades, for speaking truth to the significant omission of our history. We don't want to sit down and listen to these things, or to discuss them.

Angie For Senate,,2019-06-07 00:27:06,"I have a friend who is a Veteran. She served in the Air Force for 9 years. She was a victim of Military Sexual Assault (MST) and suffers from PTSD and other mental health and physical illnesses, all related to her MST. Her care since her discharge (honorable in the mid 90s) has been bad. At one point she was on around 30 medications- all prescribed by a nurse practitioner at the VA without any oversight from a psychiatrist. Her treatment for MST and PTSD has been insufficient and harmful.  Speaking with her about her story has led me to researching the problems in the VA and speaking with other Veterans about their care. What I‚Äôm hearing is not good- or acceptable. And the saddest, most infuriating thing I‚Äôm hearing is that Washington isn‚Äôt listening - our Senators and Congress are literally blowing them off. My friend finally received a response from Senator McSally of Arizona. Our Vets shouldn‚Äôt have to jump through hurdles to get the care they deserve and they definitely shouldn‚Äôt have to contact Senators from other states to be heard.  I strongly believe people are capable of solving their own problems. I‚Äôd like to hear more from Nebraska Veterans about the struggles and barriers they‚Äôre facing and what they need to fix it so that I can advocate for these needs as I campaign for Senate, and begin developing policy I can push as Senator to get our Vets what they need, what they were promised, what they‚Äôve EARNED.  My campaign will begin hosting some townhalls for Vets. These townhalls will give a voice to Nebraska veterans so we can develop policy we can take to Washington.

Angie For Senate,,2019-06-01 11:22:36,"Late Thursday evening President Trump threatened to impose 5% tariffs across the board on Mexico if they don‚Äôt stop the flow of migrants to the US- tariffs larger than those imposed on China. These tariffs, if imposed, will ultimately be paid by US consumers and jeopardize North American supply chains. It also places strains on the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that the administration claims to prioritize.  This is just another example of Trump attempting to bully other countries rather than practice diplomacy.  With summer coming, migration rates are expected to drop as the weather makes the journey across South America too dangerous to attempt. Honestly, these tariff threats are most likely just a way for Trump to try and take credit for the lower migration rates while failing to actually DO anything that de-escalates the crisis at our Southern Border.  Let‚Äôs be clear, America can not bully its way to diplomacy. That just isn‚Äôt how diplomacy works. This administrations harsh and inhumane handling of the migrants fleeing their countries in search of asylum are nothing more than a failure of the administration to deal with the migrant exodus. So what is the answer?  First we must understand the problem. Why are thousands of folx fleeing their homelands in Central America in search of asylum from the US?  The short answer is poverty. They need to work and provide for their families- something every hard working American can understand. The more in-depth answer is a discussion that includes a large range of topics including gangs, violence, harmful US interventions, and climate change.  I‚Äôd like to focus for a minute on climate change and how it impacts crops in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. In Nebraska we understand the importance of agriculture so we should be able to relate.  One of the reasons Central America is suffering is because they have seen a 2 degree rise in temperatures. If Nebraska saw that type of change, we couldn‚Äôt grow corn. Think of the impact that would have on us- on the US. For Central America it‚Äôs coffee. Farmers are struggling to grow coffee. This change in climate has made crops harder to grow and has brought on new diseases (for crops) and new pest problems- resulting in massive losses in already struggling countries.  Climate change must be addressed as a part of the solution to the migrant crisis.  Furthermore, we know increased poverty leads to increased violence regardless of what country you‚Äôre in. Many of these countries face extreme amounts of violence and their governments and local law enforcement are often corrupt or incapable of dealing with the violence. So people flee to the US in search of work and safety. As Warsan Shire states in the poem ‚ÄúHome‚Äù; ‚ÄúNo one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark‚Äù.   The migrant exodus is a cry for help. People are running from the mouth of a shark.  I have 3 children- 2 of which are preschool aged. I can‚Äôt imagine walking thousands of miles with no money, food, or resources unless there simply was not another choice. This is important to recognize as we discuss the crisis at our Southern Border. The demonization of these folks seeking asylum has been harmful- to them, and to us.  We knew the migrant caravans were coming. We had months to prepare. But rather than deal with this very real crisis, Trump and the GOP has used it to promote fear and implement inhumane policies. Rather than build up support and send resources to assist those seeking asylum from violence and poverty, Trump and the GOP sent soldiers and advocated to build a wall to keep them out. They‚Äôve used it to fill their pockets and seek re-election based on false pretenses.  This was our first mistake- failing to prepare adequately for what we KNEW was coming. This has resulted in some really inhumane practices including separating families and caging (and losing) children. Detention centers face extreme overcrowding placing immigrants and border patrol agents in unsafe situations. The POTUS‚Äôs rhetoric has encouraged armed militia to take it upon themselves to ‚Äúpatrol‚Äù the border, further contributing to the chaos and increasing risks to immigrants, US Citizens, and BPAs.  This administration‚Äôs immigration policies and the handling of the migrant exodus is inhumane and dangerous. We must take a humane and pro-active stance on immigration. Rather than sending troops, we should be sending social workers, healthcare professionals, and lawyers. We should be utilizing our resources in a way that helps quickly screen and process asylum seekers, rather than filling up detention centers and placing huge strains on our systems. We also must end the role for-profit prisons and detention centers play. No one should be profiting off the suffering of people. These detention centers are billion dollar industries and we can be sure that that profit is used to influence congress into inaction so this industry can continue to fill its pockets. Our money is better spent on helping fund the numerous church groups and nonprofits working to address the crisis in humane ways.  We also must work WITH Mexico and Central American countries to resolve this problem. Bullying will not help.  As Senator, I will work diligently to develop humane immigration reform. DACA recipients should receive citizenship, TPS recipients must remain protected, and diversity should be uplifted. History shows us the contributions of immigrants. We should be welcoming our neighbors with open arms- not fear. We are America- land of the free, home of the brave. It‚Äôs time we start acting like it.",4,,,3,,,1,,2517772881579952,/story.php?story_fbid=2517772881579952&id=2161190787238165

I call them, speak with their staff, and eventually I get a form letter.  I travel to D.C. with the ACLU and two dozen Nebraskans, I write my name in a book, talk to their staff, and then I get a form letter.  I attempted for 7 months to get a meeting with Congressman Bacon only to get the run around and ignored.  I stood in a hot, sweaty plane hanger in Millard for 2 hours during Senator Sasse‚Äôs kickoff, and then he didn‚Äôt even shake anyone‚Äôs hand before proclaiming he‚Äôs off on a 93 county tour and boarding his bus and heading off.  I have yet to find anyone who has actually seen the Senator on that bus since.  When I‚Äôm in office it won‚Äôt be like that. I won‚Äôt be like that. When our representatives refuse to hear us they are taking away our right to participate in our government.  When I‚Äôm your Senator, I will ensure that I make myself available to my community and my constituents.

The idea that implementing a single payer system for healthcare, expanding free public education, increased taxes on the ultra-wealthy, and refusal to treat corporations as people will lead us to our demise or stop us from being a democracy is a scare tactic used by the elitists hoarding the money to the top.

"Angie For Senate,Jessica Knurick, PhD, RD","Jessica Knurick, PhD, RD",2019-08-29 19:23:20,"Earlier today I was chatting with one of my best friends who lives in Finland. We are both pregnant with our first babies. It‚Äôs an exciting time and I‚Äôm so happy to be able to share in the experience with her. But in my conversation with her this morning, it became very clear that there is one thing that we will both experience very differently.  Maternity Leave.  You see‚Ä¶in our conversation she casually mentioned to me that she gets ‚Äúabout a year‚Äù of paid maternity leave. That is a full year that she gets to spend with her baby, full time. To bond, experience all of the firsts, and maximize the health of both mother and baby for years to come. There are 195 countries in the world. 190 offer paid maternity leave after childbirth. 5 do not. These include Lesotho, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, Swaziland, and the United States of America.  Incredible isn‚Äôt it?  For a country that prides itself on ‚Äúfamily values,‚Äù the United States does a remarkably terrible job of supporting mothers and families at an incredibly vulnerable time when they need help the most. In this country, only 12% of women are granted any kind of paid leave by their employers. And horrifyingly, 1 in 4 women are financially forced to go back to work within just 2 weeks of delivery, before their baby can even support his/her head properly. American mothers are routinely forced to leave their babies long before either of them are physically or emotionally ready to be separated. It takes a woman approximately 40 weeks to grow a baby, during which time she experiences extreme fatigue, nausea, headaches, cramping, muscle soreness, heartburn, shortness of breath, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids ‚Äì just to name a few. And she gets through this all the while working full time, often at a physically demanding and exhausting job. And that does not even touch on the incredible physical act that is childbirth itself. Women need maternity leave to not only care for their babies, but also to recover. To recover from both the physiological and psychological aspects that accompany the postpartum period, which include depression, lactation issues including mastitis, fatigue, and pain. Studies routinely show that parental leave can have a significant positive effect on the health of babies and mothers. In fact, paid parental leave can reduce infant mortality by as much as 10%. It also has been shown to increase the likelihood of infant doctor visits and vaccinations. And it increases the rate and duration of breastfeeding, which has a number of benefits for baby, including decreased rates of infection and SIDS, and lower risk for asthma and obesity later in life.  And there are benefits for mothers too. Paid maternity leave leads to lower rates of depression and improvement in overall mental health in the months and years that follow. But this is not just a moral and health-based argument. There are economic benefits to paid leave as well.  Researchers have routinely indicated that paid leave benefits women economically because they tend to go back to work and stay with the same employer, which means their wages grow at a faster rate afterward. Paid maternity leave is also associated with better job performance and retention among mothers, increased family incomes, and increased economic growth. These might be some of the reasons that literally every other industrialized country in the world offers working mothers paid maternity leave ‚Äì some offering more than a full year of paid leave.  It‚Äôs unfortunate to me that in this country, we look at women having children as a personal decision, which should only be made if one can handle the financial burden. Especially when 40% of all Americans are having a hard time earning enough to pay for rent, food, healthcare, and transportation costs, and 62% of Americans do not fall into the category of middle class. The ability to have a family, like so many things in this country, should not and must not be available only to the wealthy or those who have the means to do so.  Rather than an individual or personal decision, other countries view having children as a need to collectively grow the next generation, from which all individuals stand to benefit.  I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones. While I do not get any paid maternity leave, I do get 6 weeks partially paid short-term disability and have enough savings to get me through another 6 weeks. But really? Should we be in a situation, as the richest country in the world, where this is considered lucky? Should I be in routine conversations with working women who literally do not know how they are going to afford to take even 1-2 months off from work after the birth of their child? And should the United States of America continue to stay in the company of Lesotho, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, and Swaziland, as 190 other countries around the world do more to support their working mothers and families?  The answer has to be no. We must do better.

Even if we disagree on policy, I can still care about your well being.  I want to work to heal the rural and urban divide. Not only because I love both the rural community that raised me and the urban city I now call home, but also because I realize how our success is intertwined. We succeed together, we fail together.  When I worked with local artist #Elspeth to create my logo we discussed how I wanted to show a United and flourishing Nebraska in the artwork. I asked them to incorporate images representative of all of Nebraska. There were a few things I asked for specifically.  1. The windmills that my dad spent years drilling and working on. He used to take us out with him sometimes. These moments are some of my BEST childhood memories. We got to help drive the pick up through gates, moo at the cows, and drink fresh water from the wells.  2. The Ogallala water tower. This tower has aliens painted on it and it lights up at night, like a UFO. My grandmother use to joke with us kids that if we weren‚Äôt asleep when it lit up the aliens would come get us lol.  3. Historical representation of Grant, my home town. This is the historical building off the main road in town. The street I walked up and down a million times.  4. The wind turbines. To represent how Nebraska loves the land that hosts us and how we will lead in clean energy.  5. Corn to represent pride in our agriculture.  6.

Angie For Senate,,2019-06-01 11:22:36,"Late Thursday evening President Trump threatened to impose 5% tariffs across the board on Mexico if they don‚Äôt stop the flow of migrants to the US- tariffs larger than those imposed on China. These tariffs, if imposed, will ultimately be paid by US consumers and jeopardize North American supply chains. It also places strains on the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that the administration claims to prioritize.  This is just another example of Trump attempting to bully other countries rather than practice diplomacy.  With summer coming, migration rates are expected to drop as the weather makes the journey across South America too dangerous to attempt. Honestly, these tariff threats are most likely just a way for Trump to try and take credit for the lower migration rates while failing to actually DO anything that de-escalates the crisis at our Southern Border.  Let‚Äôs be clear, America can not bully its way to diplomacy. That just isn‚Äôt how diplomacy works. This administrations harsh and inhumane handling of the migrants fleeing their countries in search of asylum are nothing more than a failure of the administration to deal with the migrant exodus. So what is the answer?  First we must understand the problem. Why are thousands of folx fleeing their homelands in Central America in search of asylum from the US?  The short answer is poverty. They need to work and provide for their families- something every hard working American can understand. The more in-depth answer is a discussion that includes a large range of topics including gangs, violence, harmful US interventions, and climate change.  I‚Äôd like to focus for a minute on climate change and how it impacts crops in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. In Nebraska we understand the importance of agriculture so we should be able to relate.  One of the reasons Central America is suffering is because they have seen a 2 degree rise in temperatures. If Nebraska saw that type of change, we couldn‚Äôt grow corn. Think of the impact that would have on us- on the US. For Central America it‚Äôs coffee. Farmers are struggling to grow coffee. This change in climate has made crops harder to grow and has brought on new diseases (for crops) and new pest problems- resulting in massive losses in already struggling countries.  Climate change must be addressed as a part of the solution to the migrant crisis.  Furthermore, we know increased poverty leads to increased violence regardless of what country you‚Äôre in. Many of these countries face extreme amounts of violence and their governments and local law enforcement are often corrupt or incapable of dealing with the violence. So people flee to the US in search of work and safety. As Warsan Shire states in the poem ‚ÄúHome‚Äù; ‚ÄúNo one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark‚Äù.   The migrant exodus is a cry for help. People are running from the mouth of a shark.  I have 3 children- 2 of which are preschool aged. I can‚Äôt imagine walking thousands of miles with no money, food, or resources unless there simply was not another choice. This is important to recognize as we discuss the crisis at our Southern Border. The demonization of these folks seeking asylum has been harmful- to them, and to us.  We knew the migrant caravans were coming. We had months to prepare. But rather than deal with this very real crisis, Trump and the GOP has used it to promote fear and implement inhumane policies. Rather than build up support and send resources to assist those seeking asylum from violence and poverty, Trump and the GOP sent soldiers and advocated to build a wall to keep them out. They‚Äôve used it to fill their pockets and seek re-election based on false pretenses.  This was our first mistake- failing to prepare adequately for what we KNEW was coming. This has resulted in some really inhumane practices including separating families and caging (and losing) children. Detention centers face extreme overcrowding placing immigrants and border patrol agents in unsafe situations. The POTUS‚Äôs rhetoric has encouraged armed militia to take it upon themselves to ‚Äúpatrol‚Äù the border, further contributing to the chaos and increasing risks to immigrants, US Citizens, and BPAs.  This administration‚Äôs immigration policies and the handling of the migrant exodus is inhumane and dangerous. We must take a humane and pro-active stance on immigration. Rather than sending troops, we should be sending social workers, healthcare professionals, and lawyers. We should be utilizing our resources in a way that helps quickly screen and process asylum seekers, rather than filling up detention centers and placing huge strains on our systems. We also must end the role for-profit prisons and detention centers play. No one should be profiting off the suffering of people. These detention centers are billion dollar industries and we can be sure that that profit is used to influence congress into inaction so this industry can continue to fill its pockets. Our money is better spent on helping fund the numerous church groups and nonprofits working to address the crisis in humane ways.  We also must work WITH Mexico and Central American countries to resolve this problem. Bullying will not help.  As Senator, I will work diligently to develop humane immigration reform. DACA recipients should receive citizenship, TPS recipients must remain protected, and diversity should be uplifted. History shows us the contributions of immigrants. We should be welcoming our neighbors with open arms- not fear. We are America- land of the free, home of the brave. It‚Äôs time we start acting like it.",4,,,3,,,1,,2517772881579952,/story.php?story_fbid=2517772881579952&id=2161190787238165
