Outstanding student debt reached $1.41 trillion in 2019. They are delaying marriage, homeownership and other major life decisions because of the stress from college loans. Meanwhile, private companies profit at their expense.  According to a report, nearly 60% of borrowers reported that their loan servicer has given them “confusing” or “unhelpful” advice about their loans. A quarter of the respondents had confronted a surprise additional fee from their servicing company, 57% had experienced unexpected demands after a sudden change in the loan servicer, and 42% had trouble negotiating a change to the repayment plan when they had financial hardships."" See   We must support our young Kansas workforce and stand against attempts to undermine loan forgiveness programs. Our graduates must be able to attain a career without the burden of massive debt that forces them to choose between paying rent, buying food or defaulting on their loan. Today's generation has less buying power than my generation. We must remove Betsy Devos and call out predatory loan practices. This is on our watch!"" - Usha Reddi  Donate Today!

Usha Reddi For Senate,,2020-02-06 19:46:10,"Reddi on Healthcare  As a single mother of three, I remember having to do the math about which child should see a doctor or whether a problem was bad enough to see a doctor. As a teacher and elected official, I’ve seen and addressed the impact of healthcare insecurity on our Kansas communities.  The Affordable Care Act laid the groundwork for quality health care accessible to all. While Susan Wagle does everything she can to stop Medicaid expansion, and Roger Marshall believes some people “just don’t want health care,” I will be a staunch defender of the ACA and its provisions, particularly its protections for those with preexisting conditions, the provision to keep young people covered on their parents’ plans, and its protections for women’s reproductive rights.  Let’s be clear, healthcare is a human right. It’s time to think bigger and consider an idea that builds on the ACA instead of going backwards by protecting insurance giants, pharmaceutical companies, and the lobbyists and lawyers they pay to influence legislation. I support Medicare for All because it addresses each of our current injustices. We can pay less for medication, cut middlemen out of the payment system, and finally focus the structures of health care on the patient. We can say goodbye to premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and we can welcome a system that will take care of our people from infancy into their golden years.  We need insurance that encompasses dental care, vision, and women’s health care and treats substance abuse and mental illness, regardless of a patient’s income, job, age or gender.

This is our Constitutional system of checks and balances in action. Republican loyalty, of course, is based on one calculation: Whether staying on the President’s bandwagon will help them get reelected or not. But as your Senator, I would base my role as a public servant on being true to my conscience and my constituents’ well-being, not on riding my party's coattails.  As twice-elected leader on the City Commission of Manhattan, KS, and soon to be mayor of Manhattan, I know through my years of public service that wasting my time on partisan calculations is a waste of our political energy.
