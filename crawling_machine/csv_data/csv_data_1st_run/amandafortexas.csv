Our people-powered movement didn’t make it through the primary - but that doesn’t mean we didn’t make a difference.  Texas is ready for transformative change. Many Texans stood in line to vote for hours to cast their vote to make sure their voices were heard. And our movement played an important part in getting people fired up and ready to go vote in November.‬ ‪ Thank you for being a part of our people-powered movement. Thank you for making a difference. Thank you for fighting for transformative change.

Amanda Edwards For Texas,,2020-02-15 09:20:05,"From @texassouthern to @wileycollege1873 - I have been engaging lots of young people about the issues that matter to them! One student asked me, “how do I get politicians and others to come to and be interested in my campus [Wiley College]” in light of the facts that it is a small #HBCU in a more rural part of Texas. I explained to her that what you may perceive to be obstacles or weaknesses are in fact your strengths. Students at Wiley College and others can be a voice for HBCUs, youth, rural Texas and so much more, and those charged to lead must make it a priority to connect to places like these to ensure the long term sustainability of our HBCUs, rural communities and our youth. I suggested they host a forum since as their voices must be amplified and they matter too! #amandafortexas",23,18,,5,,,,1,2474059679483912,/story.php?story_fbid=2474059679483912&id=2301300770093138

Amanda Edwards For Texas,,2020-02-13 08:14:18,"When I was 8 years I lost my cousin, Reggie, to gun violence. It was right after Christmas. He was more like a brother than a cousin to me since my mom and grandmother helped to raise him when he was young. He was the apple of everybody’s eye. I remember learning about where in the street he was murdered and how they took his tennis shoes and starter jacket. His killer was never found, and the pain that resulted remains deep. My story is not an isolated one and sheds light to the need to have sensible broad gun violence policies in our country. We must recognize that gun violence is a broad issue and needs to be tackled with solutions that address killings ranging from suicide, domestic homicides, murders like my cousin’s, mass shootings, and those in between. For a long time gun violence prevention was not on the radar, and after Columbine (when I was in high school) it began to be more widely discussed. Sadly, we have even seen children become activists on this issue in order to try to make progress. Families and communities everywhere are counting on us to do more than just talk about these issues, we must do something now and not just remain stuck in a debate.

This picture was taken at my 2016 Swearing-In as an At-Large Houston City Council Member. In that moment, I was excited, optimistic & trying to be very careful to not slip on the Jones Hall Stage (many people don’t know that I can be a little clumsy). I remember my shy mother being nervous as we waited backstage and then how excited she was once we walked onstage. I am grateful to her for her unconditional love & strength as she has been my rock. I love her dearly & could not have had anyone better to walk that stage with me - I now pray for her continued strength as she is battling cancer. To say that it has been tough is an understatement, but we will persevere. I am grateful to have been elected to serve the 2.3 million Houstonians that now hold a permanent space in my heart. To every person that would pick up the phone when I would seek to partner with you in the community, THANK YOU. . . To all of the people that called the city & my office and allowed us the opportunity to serve them & restore their confidence that someone in gov’t could help, THANK YOU. . . To the staff, volunteers & interns who worked to achieve our office mission to make Houston the place where the Gulf Coast & the World’s future meet & to treat residents the same way you would want someone to treat your grandmother, THANK YOU. . . To every entrepreneur, ecosystem builder, collaborator, resident, thought parter, the mayor, colleague, community stakeholder & advocate who joined me to have a seat at a table that did not place the community on the menu, THANK YOU. . . To my residents who would answer the door when we knocked or who simply believe that we can realize our potential as a community, THANK YOU! My service of this community has been such an immense blessing, and I THANK YOU for allowing me to serve.

Amanda Edwards For Texas,,2019-10-25 09:44:28,"The rising costs of tuition are saddling graduates with mortgage-like debt before they have even stepped foot in an open house. Student loan debt, which is now more than $1.5 trillion, is impeding many Americans from realizing what many conceive of to be the American Dream of home ownership because of the debt burden they face. Access to higher education is critically important, both for students preparing to enter the workforce, as well as for those who are already working and need to keep their skills current. But the exploding cost of tuition is denying access to needed education, and burdening too many with massive loan debt.  Check out our ""Policy to the People: Student Debt 101"" exploring tuition costs and how we can get them under control.",13,11,,2,,,,,2376507332572481,/story.php?story_fbid=2376507332572481&id=2301300770093138

They want people to get focused,” she says. “What is constant is the disdain and lack of satisfaction with the status quo.

Amanda Edwards For Texas,,2019-08-15 07:30:31,"I know I’m not the likeliest candidate for U.S. Senate. Today I want to tell you a little more about the personal reasons behind my commitment to service. I lost my dad to cancer when I was 17 years old. He was diagnosed with cancer when I was in the 4th grade. As time went on and treatments did as well, I asked him many questions about his illness and treatments like, ""who is paying for this?"" and, ""what happens if the insurance company says 'no' to the treatment?"" Although my dad had access to high-quality, life-extending healthcare, so many Texas families do not -- and that's unacceptable. I had my father until my junior year of high school -- he passed away just months after he accompanied me on the field for homecoming at Eisenhower High School. Those extra years with my dad were pivotal for me in my formative years, and I am grateful for each extra day he was with me. This experience is my personal why - I want to make sure that young people like I was have their families intact a little while longer. I want to make sure that we understand that issues like access to healthcare are life and death, not a political game. This is part of the purpose that fuels my mission to make sure that we have serious leaders committed and capable of delivering results that matter most to us. If you're with me, I can use your help.
