Dr. Roger Marshall,,2020-03-04 13:06:38,"There’s a clear choice for Kansas — and all of America — in November.  Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have spent 86 years in elected office. They’ve supported failed liberal policies that hurt working Americans, raised your taxes, and diminished our country's standing in the world. And they’ve made it clear they have nothing but contempt for our Kansas values and way of life.  No matter who becomes the Democrat nominee, there will be a clear choice between decades of failure and four more years of results under President Trump. Here in Kansas, my Republican opponents have spent a combined 68 years running for or holding office. They have all lost elections to Democrats. Chuck Schumer and his hand-picked candidate would rather face any of them than me.  Unlike them, I’ve spent my career in medicine, delivering more than 5,000 babies and always protecting life. I’ve served our country in the military and worked in agriculture and business.  And just like President Trump, I was elected in 2016 to make a difference.  In the House, I’ve stood with our President, helped negotiate the USMCA, fought for our Kansas values, and defended life. Unlike Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and all of my opponents in this Senate race, politics is not my career and the next election isn’t my focus — results are.  At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter who the Democrats nominate… but that’s not the case for Kansas Republicans. Chuck Schumer is doing everything he can to buy our Senate seat, and it gets a lot easier for him if we nominate a career politician who has proven they can’t win a general election.  You deserve a Senator who hasn’t spent their career looking for the next taxpayer-funded office to run for.  You deserve a Senator who understands your struggles, who has signed a paycheck and built a business, who is focused on results, and who shares your values.  You deserve a Senator who has and will stand with our President, hold the radical left accountable, and make a positive difference for Kansas and all of America.  That’s what I’ve done in the House and that’s what I’m ready to do on day one in the Senate.

Dr. Roger Marshall,,2019-12-31 10:46:38,"Happy new year to you, your family, and your community! As we close out 2019 – and the past decade – we take a moment to reflect on those things that have happened, and the things to come. First of all, I am grateful for my faith and my family. If you had told us 10 years ago that we’d be involved in politics, and working with the President to pass a massive new trade deal, I would have laughed. Yet, here we are. Many of you have heard me quote the Book of Esther, where the Old Testament says you are where you are “for a time such as this.” I believe with all my heart that we have been called to serve. It has been an honor. In 2019, our family got to witness the marriage of my oldest son, Victor, and welcome his bride Chrissy into the family. Our children and grandchildren continue to navigate life, and our parents, brothers, sisters and their families continue to have reasonably good health, and like my grandma always said, “if you have your health, you have everything.” 2019 was a huge year for our country and our state. President Trump continued delivering results for the American people, most recently with both the USMCA and a Phase One trade deal with China. Our economy continued its amazing turnaround to the strongest economy of my professional life, with unemployment falling to historic lows and wages rising to new heights. In fact, the average hard-working American family has $7,000 more in 2019 than they did 4 years ago! Democrats, on the other hand, continued their obsession with obstructing our President at every turn. Now, they’ve weaponized the impeachment process because they can’t get over losing one election and they’re afraid of losing another in 2020. Not only that, the Democrat Party has continued its march to the radical Left, openly embracing a socialist agenda that would transform what has made America great. 2019 was also big for our family in that it was the year that Laina and I made the decision that it was time to run for the United States Senate. The support we’ve been shown over the last several months has been humbling. I made the decision to run for one simple reason: I want to leave Kansas – the state where I was born and raised, and the state where I raised my family – better than I found it. I want to leave this country better than I found it. I want our kids and grandkids to have the same shot at the American dream that I’ve had. This campaign is about the state I was born and raised, and raised my children – the state I love. It’s about the future we want for Kansas, and for all of America. Our future will be defined by what happens in 2020. Every election seems like it’s “the most important ever,” but never before have socialists gained such a vocal foothold in our country, and to keep this republic, we will all have to stand tall. No one said it would be easy. This is the time for a generation of Americans to stand up and fight back. 🔘 In 2020, we must continue to stand strong and lead against the Left’s impeachment sham and support President Trump’s agenda. 🔘In 2020, we must continue to call out and fight the Left’s embrace of radical socialism. 🔘In 2020, we must continue to stand for life, for our jobs, our farmers, our ranchers, our workers, our businesses, and the Kansas values we hold dear. Kansans stick together. We win together. We are a team, united for our families, our communities, and our future. If we are going to leave our state and nation better than we found it, it’s going to take all of us working together. Laina and I are ready for what’s ahead. I hope you’ll join us.",319,286,1,30,1,,1,61,1387906084723607,/story.php?story_fbid=1387906084723607&id=111324359048459

Thomas Stanley was nearing his finish of FlatRock 50K & 25K and was struck by lightning.

Dr. Roger Marshall,,2019-12-31 10:46:38,"Happy new year to you, your family, and your community! As we close out 2019 – and the past decade – we take a moment to reflect on those things that have happened, and the things to come. First of all, I am grateful for my faith and my family. If you had told us 10 years ago that we’d be involved in politics, and working with the President to pass a massive new trade deal, I would have laughed. Yet, here we are. Many of you have heard me quote the Book of Esther, where the Old Testament says you are where you are “for a time such as this.” I believe with all my heart that we have been called to serve. It has been an honor. In 2019, our family got to witness the marriage of my oldest son, Victor, and welcome his bride Chrissy into the family. Our children and grandchildren continue to navigate life, and our parents, brothers, sisters and their families continue to have reasonably good health, and like my grandma always said, “if you have your health, you have everything.” 2019 was a huge year for our country and our state. President Trump continued delivering results for the American people, most recently with both the USMCA and a Phase One trade deal with China. Our economy continued its amazing turnaround to the strongest economy of my professional life, with unemployment falling to historic lows and wages rising to new heights. In fact, the average hard-working American family has $7,000 more in 2019 than they did 4 years ago! Democrats, on the other hand, continued their obsession with obstructing our President at every turn. Now, they’ve weaponized the impeachment process because they can’t get over losing one election and they’re afraid of losing another in 2020. Not only that, the Democrat Party has continued its march to the radical Left, openly embracing a socialist agenda that would transform what has made America great. 2019 was also big for our family in that it was the year that Laina and I made the decision that it was time to run for the United States Senate. The support we’ve been shown over the last several months has been humbling. I made the decision to run for one simple reason: I want to leave Kansas – the state where I was born and raised, and the state where I raised my family – better than I found it. I want to leave this country better than I found it. I want our kids and grandkids to have the same shot at the American dream that I’ve had. This campaign is about the state I was born and raised, and raised my children – the state I love. It’s about the future we want for Kansas, and for all of America. Our future will be defined by what happens in 2020. Every election seems like it’s “the most important ever,” but never before have socialists gained such a vocal foothold in our country, and to keep this republic, we will all have to stand tall. No one said it would be easy. This is the time for a generation of Americans to stand up and fight back. 🔘 In 2020, we must continue to stand strong and lead against the Left’s impeachment sham and support President Trump’s agenda. 🔘In 2020, we must continue to call out and fight the Left’s embrace of radical socialism. 🔘In 2020, we must continue to stand for life, for our jobs, our farmers, our ranchers, our workers, our businesses, and the Kansas values we hold dear. Kansans stick together. We win together. We are a team, united for our families, our communities, and our future. If we are going to leave our state and nation better than we found it, it’s going to take all of us working together. Laina and I are ready for what’s ahead. I hope you’ll join us.",319,286,1,30,1,,1,61,1387906084723607,/story.php?story_fbid=1387906084723607&id=111324359048459

This doesn’t even rise to the standard given to Presidents Nixon and Clinton. Furthermore, it doesn’t allow Republican to fully participate in the process.  Today’s vote means Schiff will continue his secret hearings. It allows him – and him alone – to decide what documents or people Republicans can subpoena. Essentially, it allows Schiff to name himself prosecutor, juror, and judge.  Every American citizen is entitled to due process. Today, House Democrats denied the President that right. This is a Soviet-style process that flies in the face of our Constitution.  Kansans will see this for what it is: Petty politics meant to reverse the will of the People.",599,375,8,7,10,43,156,142,1327813507399532,/story.php?story_fbid=1327813507399532&id=111324359048459

Laina and I ask that you keep them in your prayers, as well. For details on how to help following this tragedy, please see below:It's been a bit of radio silence over here. A tragedy occurred to one of our own this weekend. A beloved member of our running community was taken from us on Saturday. Thomas Stanley was nearing his finish of FlatRock 50K & 25K and was struck by lightning. To quote his family: ""... the chances of being killed by a lightning strike are about one in a million, and Thomas was truly a one-in-a-million guy."" Our hearts are with Thomas' wife Ashley, their beautiful children, all his family, and the huge community who loved him. We were reminded this weekend of an interview the Wichita Eagle conducted as we prepared for our 1st PFM event. Thomas and Ashley were featured as they prepared for their first marathon.
