Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2019-11-11 08:24:37,"Kids these days, a few thoughts on Veterans Day. A few years ago, I was working a construction job at a Special Forces camp in the Horn of Africa and it was grueling. So, when we sat down to shove some lunch in our faces, the last thing I wanted to hear was a civilian, who’d never worn a uniform, running his mouth about what he considered the sorry state of the men and women in service today. Maybe my boss was having a bad day and just venting, but after about five minutes of him banging on about “kids these days,” I nodded toward a guy at an adjacent table and asked, “Why don’t you go tell that guy what you think?” The man in question was bearded, heavily muscled and tattooed, and his uniform showed neither rank nor service. “Go on, go tell that guy what you think of him.” I don’t know what the guy’s job really was, but I’d have bet a paycheck it involved going dangerous places and doing violent things to bad people. My boss wisely demurred but continued with a tired litany against video games, energy drinks, air-conditioned quarters and high-tech weapons, optics and communications equipment. I had enough and gave him both barrels.  My argument probably would have been more persuasive without the profanity and personal invective but here’s the gist of it. Kids in uniform these days, and they all look like kids to me, have been at war almost all their lives. Something that has never happened in the history of our nation. A soldier, sailor, airman or Marine in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan or any other of the dozens of conflict zones around the world was, at best, a preschooler when our country was attacked on September 11th, 2001. They could be in college. They could be plying their adept knowledge of technology in industry. They could be at home drinking a cold beer with their friends. Or they could be attending weddings, funerals, birthdays, anniversaries, bar mitzvahs, first communions or baptisms like all their friends and relatives. But they’re not; they’ve volunteered to serve their country in uniform and are far from home.  Only 13 percent of today’s 19- 23-year-olds are mentally, morally and physically qualified to serve. Because of pre-existing medical or mental health issues, level of education, obesity, inaptitude, criminal record or having dependents, almost all our children aren’t even eligible to serve in the military. That means the burden of America’s wars are being borne by a very small percentage of the population. So, if we can train, equip, transport, house and feed them in comfort, should we not because of some perception that it indicates weakness? They’ve lived their entire lives with phones that can deliver, even in a combat zone, information, imagery and geospatial data that would have been the fantasies of war planners scant decades ago. At most sporting goods stores you can buy optics for weapons that make accurate shooting at night or at a distance a reality for the average rifleman. We don’t even think about the fact that almost every car on the road is equipped with radios and navigation systems communicating with satellites orbiting thousands of miles above the earth. Would we deny them these advantages? The enemy uses them. And despite all the technological advantages, they operate in an environment of great ambiguity. The enemy no longer wears uniforms identifying them as combatants. There is no longer a line on their maps beyond which everyone is a bad guy. We’ve pushed life-or-death decision making down to “kids” whose most important decision a few years ago was what to wear to the prom. A wrong decision, made in fear, or confusion or under a perceived threat can be recorded, broadcast and judged in real time. The veterans of our 2nd longest war, Vietnam, taught us that the ambiguity of their mission and perceived futility of their efforts contribute to post-traumatic stress. Like them, today’s veterans have also been exposed to toxic chemicals with long-term health consequences. And, like them, they have a far higher rate of suicide then their non-serving counterparts. While today we honor all veterans, take a moment to contemplate the sacrifices of some kids these days and commit yourself to their care. “Thank you for your service,” doesn’t let you off the hook. They’d rather have a well-functioning VA clinic in their area. They’d rather not have to fight decades for their service-related health difficulties to be recognized. And, they’d rather have their spouses and children receive their earned benefits should they die young.  But all of that is expensive. If we are going to engage in endless wars, or any war, our first responsibility as citizens is to acknowledge all the associated costs, fiscal, physical and mental, of sending our young people to fight, and pay the bills when they come due. At least some kids these days are in harm’s way. Whether on patrol through some nameless village in Afghanistan or standing guard at a remote camp in central Africa, they’ve signed on for something most of their peers have not. And they will bear the scars of their service, inside and out, when they return. Let’s not make any of them ever fight for the benefits we owe them.",120,83,,37,,,,13,579725846106642,/story.php?story_fbid=579725846106642&id=496341171111777

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2019-09-04 14:51:53,"There's a lot to unpack from Mitch McConnell's weekend radio interview but three things stand out. First, he called his critics liars for saying he personally blocked a Senate vote on election security already passed by the House. The fact is, he did. Secondly, he accused his critics of McCarthyism for hanging the name Moscow Mitch on him. He freely accuses me of having ""socialist fantasies"" to scare Kentucky voters but complains when he is called out for resisting attempts to inform the nation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and for exchanging in-place sanctions on a criminal Russian oligarch for a pork barrel project in his home state. Finally, he claims he is immune from scrutiny because he is a ""Cold Warrior."" For those of us who know McConnell's history, he is anything but a warrior. Warriors put their lives on the line for what they believe in. The McConnells of the world happily send others parents, children and spouses off to fight their ideological battles. McConnell and I entered federal service in the same year, 1984. I went on to lead Marines around the world throughout the peak power of the Soviet empire and the chaos that followed its collapse. Mitch grew fat in Washington on corrupt deals that consolidated his political power and grew his personal wealth. One of us is a farmer in Lincoln County and the other is a multi-multi-millionaire in Washington. https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/459747-mcconnell-over-the-top-moscow-mitch-nickname-effort-to-smear-me",1.2K,811,280,90,22,8,52,344,527513411327886,/story.php?story_fbid=527513411327886&id=496341171111777

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2019-08-11 08:46:10,"Military exercises in the Republic of Korea are not “ridiculous,” despite the President’s recent comments, and I’d argue are critical for a successful deterrence to North Korea aggression.  I participated in exercises in the ROK throughout the 80’s and in 2000 started a two-year assignment in Seoul as the Marine Forces Korea war planner (MARFORK-ACS G5) and keenly appreciate the challenges of defending a country whose capitol and it’s 13-million citizens are within artillery and rocket range of a blood thirsty and vicious regime. First and foremost, we need to understand that the defense of the ROK is unlike any other US military partnership. It is not a US-led coalition with our South Korean allies playing a subordinate role; it is a full-on partnership with the ROK bearing most of the burden in lives and treasure. Our ROK allies are earnest and selfless and will bear a disproportionate burden in blood if the President’s ill-considered words embolden the North Korean dictator to attack. Effective coordination in a complex battlespace across language and cultural divides requires constant tending and exercising command and control, mobilization and deployment of forces are critical for success.  Though it’s fallen into fashion lately to exonerate him, Dean Acheson address to the National Press Club in 1949 failed to include South Korea in a list of our defensive priorities in the far Pacific; six months later, North Korea attacked. The signaling the president is now engaged in is far less nuanced than Acheson’s and, considering his outspoken affection for the North Korean dictator, dangerous to a great friend and ally.  I’ll leave you with this thought. The day after 9-11, I exited work after 24-hours of trying to assess the impact on the peninsula of the attacks on US soil to find that the ROK Marine Corps had placed a physical barrier between the MARFORK headquarters and the adjacent road.  Our HQ was literally within spitting distance of a main thoroughfare through the capitol and ROK Marines had, unsolicited, lined that wall with their bodies and armored vehicles. Placed themselves physically between we who worked unknowingly behind a brick wall and some as yet unknown threat. Those young Korean Marines stood a lonely vigil throughout the long winter that followed without complaint or recognition. That, to me, is a worthy ally and friend.",149,77,2,1,15,8,46,22,512426426169918,/story.php?story_fbid=512426426169918&id=496341171111777

Mike Broihier for Kentucky,,2019-07-30 18:46:55,"My friends, I’ve spent a lot of time overseas. I’ve lived or worked, at one time or another, in countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. When I’d meet young people, I’d always ask them, “What do you think of America?” Their answer most often was, “I dream of America.”  They weren’t speaking figuratively. They literally dreamt of our country. The dreamt of freedom, safety, democracy, opportunity, education and equality. To them, that was America. Yesterday, news surfaced that Kentucky’s other perpetual embarrassment, Rand Paul, decided to insult Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) saying he’d buy her a plane ticket back to Somalia so she could learn to “…appreciate America more.” What Paul doesn’t understand is that Omar, who came to the US from Somalia via a refugee camp in Kenya, doesn’t need a lesson in appreciating America because she knows what it is supposed to be. She fled a war-torn, starving nation and spent four years in a camp; I bet, dreaming of America.  That she see’s in America’s economic, racial, social and political schisms a threat to the American dream, or the dream of America, and is willing to speak out about it is the most patriotic thing she could be doing.
