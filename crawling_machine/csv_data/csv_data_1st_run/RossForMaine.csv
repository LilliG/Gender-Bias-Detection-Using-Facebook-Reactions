Its 2020 and voting rights are under attack, hate crimes are on the rise and many of our leaders in Washington seem most interested in helping the wealthy get wealthier. It's also an election year. And I have a feeling that Americans will show up to the polls with the same passion that brought a quarter of a million Americans to the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2020-01-16 12:50:11,"Each of our U.S. Senators will take an oath today to deliver ""impartial justice"" in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Even so, what‚Äôs happening in the Senate won't be a trial. You don‚Äôt have to be a lawyer to know that in a democracy, a trial means evidence, witnesses, and an impartial judge and jury. When Mitch McConnell announced he‚Äôs coordinating with the White House counsel, it was as outrageous as a jury foreman announcing he's working to help the defense attorney. Susan Collins has spent more than twenty years in Washington. It's become clear that she's more interested in appeasing Mitch McConnell and President Trump than seeking the truth about this president's abuses of power. That's wrong, and that's why I'm running against her.  We deserve a Senator who will follow the facts impartially and put our democracy ahead of loyalty to a political party.

Since 2003, we have lost too many brave men and women in the Middle East. My father, a proud veteran, still bears the scars of the Vietnam War.

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2019-12-11 17:54:58,"Thank you to Governor Janet Mills for leading the creation of an economic development plan for Maine. This plan is the first of its kind in more than two decades, and sadly, we can see the impact of that all around us.  Maine was recently ranked the 49th state in terms of economic growth. That means fewer good paying jobs for working Maine families. Governor Mills' plan includes revitalizing our aging infrastructure, rural broadband initiatives, and efforts to increase our workforce. These are critical issues:  it's very hard to start a new business, work remotely, or educate our kids for the economy of the future without reliable high-speed internet! I applaud Governor Mills for her leadership, and look forward to partnering with her in the U.S. Senate to provide federal support for this plan.

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2019-11-26 14:48:36,"After I launched my campaign, I hit the road to talk with working Mainers all across our state. I'll continue sharing the stories of the people I meet, because far too many Mainers are working hard, doing their best, and playing by the rules -- and still, they're struggling to get by. That's why I'm running for the U.S. Senate: because Mainers deserve better. I met Barbara while visiting a pharmacy in Orono. She‚Äôs trained as a Certified Medical Assistant (CMA) but can't afford to maintain her CMA certification. Barbara is trying to find a job that will pay enough to support herself and her daughter, but so far hasn't been able to find one.  Barbara is a single mother who receives food stamps and MaineCare. She wants to work, but knows that if she takes even a low-paying job, she and her daughter will likely be kicked off MaineCare. Barbara confided that she feels guilty about using public assistance programs, but believes it‚Äôs the best option she has for her daughter. We need all the healthcare workers we can get in Maine -- we‚Äôre the oldest state in the nation -- and have to be sure that our workers are not only paid a living wage, but also have access to the type of healthcare that they're providing to others.  If I'm elected to the U.S. Senate, I'll fight like hell to ensure that Maine receives the federal assistance needed to provide high quality, affordable healthcare to all Mainers. #RossonTour #RossForMaine #MESen",27,25,,2,,,,4,129448598479565,/story.php?story_fbid=129448598479565&id=104853560939069

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2019-11-21 19:41:18,"Last week, I hit the road to talk with working Mainers all across our state. For the next few days I'll share the stories of a few of the Mainers I met along the way. I met Brooke in Lewiston, where she works as a barista.  Brooke‚Äôs father suffered from severe nerve pain, and was prescribed opiate pain killers to help him manage his pain.  A year into his treatment, Brooke‚Äôs father admitted to her that he was addicted -- that he needed the pills to get by.  Brooke‚Äôs father struggled with his addiction for about five years, before he passed away in August.  Brooke -- just 22 -- told me that she hadn‚Äôt been able to attend college because she had to work and take care of her father for the last three years of his life.  At the end of our talk, Brooke said something to me that I‚Äôll remember for a very long time: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to do everything right, but it‚Äôs just not working for me.‚Äù Brooke shared her phone number with me and when I called her to hear more about her story, the call dropped not once -- but five times. Our difficulty in having a simple phone call was another sign of how Maine‚Äôs leaders need to do more.  In far too many parts of the state, there is unreliable mobile phone coverage, let alone high speed internet availability.  This is the basic infrastructure that every Mainer deserves, and which is necessary for Maine to grow its economy. Brooke has done all the right things, but our leaders aren‚Äôt doing right by her -- just as we didn‚Äôt provide her father with the help they needed to beat his addiction.  As painful as it is, Brooke‚Äôs story is far too common throughout Maine.   Health care resources for folks struggling with addiction, support for young students who don‚Äôt have the financial means to attend college, and widely-available high speed internet aren‚Äôt just policy issues: these are the resources that will change the lives of young people like Brooke. We cannot leave her behind. #RossforMaine #RossonTour",43,38,,5,,,,2,127297772027981,/story.php?story_fbid=127297772027981&id=104853560939069

This plan is the first of its kind in more than two decades, and sadly, we can see the impact of that all around us.  Maine was recently ranked the 49th state in terms of economic growth. That means fewer good paying jobs for working Maine families. Governor Mills' plan includes revitalizing our aging infrastructure, rural broadband initiatives, and efforts to increase our workforce. These are critical issues:  it's very hard to start a new business, work remotely, or educate our kids for the economy of the future without reliable high-speed internet! I applaud Governor Mills for her leadership, and look forward to partnering with her in the U.S. Senate to provide federal support for this plan.

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2019-12-02 18:49:47,"Here's a flash from the past: my mother Pearl, juggling her three kids. I'm the one in gray üôÇ Not only did my mom take care of my siblings and me, she also babysat neighborhood kids and cleaned homes in Kennebunkport to make ends meet for our family. Too many families in Maine are working hard and doing their best, just like my mother did -- and still, they‚Äôre struggling to get by. I know what that feels like, because that's how I grew up. At one point, we almost lost our home. Things aren't any easier for working families today -- they‚Äôve gotten worse.

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2019-11-26 14:48:36,"After I launched my campaign, I hit the road to talk with working Mainers all across our state. I'll continue sharing the stories of the people I meet, because far too many Mainers are working hard, doing their best, and playing by the rules -- and still, they're struggling to get by. That's why I'm running for the U.S. Senate: because Mainers deserve better. I met Barbara while visiting a pharmacy in Orono. She‚Äôs trained as a Certified Medical Assistant (CMA) but can't afford to maintain her CMA certification. Barbara is trying to find a job that will pay enough to support herself and her daughter, but so far hasn't been able to find one.  Barbara is a single mother who receives food stamps and MaineCare. She wants to work, but knows that if she takes even a low-paying job, she and her daughter will likely be kicked off MaineCare. Barbara confided that she feels guilty about using public assistance programs, but believes it‚Äôs the best option she has for her daughter. We need all the healthcare workers we can get in Maine -- we‚Äôre the oldest state in the nation -- and have to be sure that our workers are not only paid a living wage, but also have access to the type of healthcare that they're providing to others.  If I'm elected to the U.S. Senate, I'll fight like hell to ensure that Maine receives the federal assistance needed to provide high quality, affordable healthcare to all Mainers. #RossonTour #RossForMaine #MESen",27,25,,2,,,,4,129448598479565,/story.php?story_fbid=129448598479565&id=104853560939069

Ross LaJeunesse for Maine,,2019-11-21 19:41:18,"Last week, I hit the road to talk with working Mainers all across our state. For the next few days I'll share the stories of a few of the Mainers I met along the way. I met Brooke in Lewiston, where she works as a barista.  Brooke‚Äôs father suffered from severe nerve pain, and was prescribed opiate pain killers to help him manage his pain.  A year into his treatment, Brooke‚Äôs father admitted to her that he was addicted -- that he needed the pills to get by.  Brooke‚Äôs father struggled with his addiction for about five years, before he passed away in August.  Brooke -- just 22 -- told me that she hadn‚Äôt been able to attend college because she had to work and take care of her father for the last three years of his life.  At the end of our talk, Brooke said something to me that I‚Äôll remember for a very long time: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to do everything right, but it‚Äôs just not working for me.‚Äù Brooke shared her phone number with me and when I called her to hear more about her story, the call dropped not once -- but five times. Our difficulty in having a simple phone call was another sign of how Maine‚Äôs leaders need to do more.  In far too many parts of the state, there is unreliable mobile phone coverage, let alone high speed internet availability.  This is the basic infrastructure that every Mainer deserves, and which is necessary for Maine to grow its economy. Brooke has done all the right things, but our leaders aren‚Äôt doing right by her -- just as we didn‚Äôt provide her father with the help they needed to beat his addiction.  As painful as it is, Brooke‚Äôs story is far too common throughout Maine.   Health care resources for folks struggling with addiction, support for young students who don‚Äôt have the financial means to attend college, and widely-available high speed internet aren‚Äôt just policy issues: these are the resources that will change the lives of young people like Brooke. We cannot leave her behind. #RossforMaine #RossonTour",43,38,,5,,,,2,127297772027981,/story.php?story_fbid=127297772027981&id=104853560939069
