Many of the same corporations that are benefiting financially from the incarceration of prisoners over cannabis in our state are also making millions from the sell of cannabis in other states.

Antoine Pierce,,2020-01-16 21:14:05,"It's time for a family meeting. Can we be candid? Too often, especially in statewide campaigns, Democratic voters, particularly black voter's, desires are considered as an afterthought. We have for too long been relegated to political sharecropping. Black people have been consistently the most loyal and core base of the Democratic Party, but to what end?  Our votes are viewed as inherent, not worthy of being earned through policies that are inclusive of our nuanced needs. When pressed on our issues, we are told to wait for the rising tide to lift our boats. Why? Because political strategists can rely on Democratic voters, especially black voters, to be pragmatic. We will reliably and often regrettably hold our noses and choose the ""lesser or two evils."" The monied interests, wealthy elite, political gate keepers, and political kingmakers finance and elevate the candidates that they want us to choose, tell us who we need to vote for, and often shame or guilt voters into choosing that person. If we refuse to support the only option we've been given we'd be blamed for the inevitable and disastrous decline that ensues when the other party wins. They know our pragmatism won't allow us to choose the policy extremes of the Republican candidate. Therefore, that leaves us with a false choice.  Candidates like myself and others who aren't self funding millionaires or aren't in the ""good ole boys"" club are often written off by the establishment as unelectable because our resumes don't match those of career politicians or those who are already wealthy enough to buy the seat that they want.  This perpetuates a vicious cycle of mobilization, false promises, disappointment, disengagement, and ultimately the disenfranchisement of countless people who believed that the best choice and the only choice they had was the candidate with the most funds in their coffers.  Some of you who read this may have written our campaign off because you've decided that a win for a grassroots campaign like ours is impossible. You've decided that an unknown candidate who isn't a millionaire doesn't have a chance against an incumbent mega funded Republican in Louisiana. So you've chosen to ignore us and withhold your support while you wait for someone who checks off all your ""must have"" boxes. Nevertheless, this campaign is a virtuous one. We know we don't have what super funded campaigns have, but we also know what change we want to accomplish and we're committed to hearing and engaging the people who have been disenfranchised.  I hope that you will consider our platform and we hope to earn your support. Whether we raise $1 or $10 million, we aren't going ANYWHERE! We will continue fighting for the things that matter to Louisianans! We'll see you in November!

Cassidy's praise of this military action, despite the lack of evidence that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to our national security, is a clear demonstration of his willingness to forsake the safety of our soldiers and allies in the Middle East for the sake of remaining in the good graces of President whose destabilizing foreign policy agenda is questionable at best. Patriotism is not blind allegiance to the President or a political party! Patriotism is unwavering devotion to our country and the rule of law. I love my country! That's why I must hold its leadership accountable, more especially those who refuse to step beyond the confines of their required allegiance to the president and political expedience to do what is in the best interest of our national security. Two of Cassidy's fellow Republicans disagree with him concerning the President's order. Senators Mike Lee (UT) and Rand Paul (KY) maintain that there was no evidence presented during the recent Congressional briefing that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to the U.S. Neither Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the acting Sec. of Defense, nor any other member of Trump's National Security team can provide any evidence to the public or members of Congress of an imminent threat to our troops in the region or our national security. The last time we engaged in war with another country, it was under the guise of the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which we later discovered was a lie. There has not been one shred of evidence that this assassination of Soleimani made America or our allies in the region safer. In fact, the evidence provided by our intelligence agencies lends to the contrary. Therefore, the unilateral decision made by the President to order such an act of war was both egregious and indefensible. Most Americans have no desire to engage in another endless and expensive war without verifiable evidence, especially one that was seemingly instigated for the sake of saving the presidency of one of the most corrupt and immoral Presidents we've seen in modern times. Congress must utilize its Article I powers and pass war resolutions that restrain the President's ability to order unprovoked attacks that drag our country into war for his own political gain. ""Our President will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. He’s weak and he’s ineffective. So the only way he figures that he’s going to get reelected…and as sure as you’re sitting there, is to start a war with Iran. I believe that he will attack Iran sometime prior to the election because he thinks that’s the only way he can get elected. Isn’t it pathetic?"" - Donald J. Trump Cassidy and his Republican colleagues in Congress must find the fortitude to put partisanship and political expedience aside to hold the President accountable when his actions threaten out national security and the safety of our allies around the world.",19,19,,,,,,,1293757400816557,/story.php?story_fbid=1293757400816557&id=237033019822339

The funds from these cuts should've been used by corporations to provide paid family leave for every employee. Instead, people were laid off, companies bought back their stocks, and CEOs received ungodly pay raises.  Universal Paid Famliy leave would ensure that every parent can take time away from work to care for their loved ones without the fear of being unable to obtain their basic needs.",30,24,,6,,,,2,1248505972008367,/story.php?story_fbid=1248505972008367&id=237033019822339

Antoine Pierce,,2019-06-15 17:15:28,"I once read a story about a baby born over 2000 year ago whose family were refugees. While still pregnant with him, his mother and father sought asylum in another land. That baby's family was not welcomed in their new land. Consequently, that baby was born outdoors and in the worst of conditions. Nevertheless, that baby became one of the greatest examples of love and peace that the world has ever known. That baby's story is still being told today.  The moral: Be careful how you treat people. Those you mistreat or turn away today may be the very people you need tomorrow.",7,3,,4,,,,,1102390919953207,/story.php?story_fbid=1102390919953207&id=237033019822339

Antoine Pierce,,2019-04-23 11:36:28,"I'm a liberal democrat. I support a mandatory living wage. I'm pro-choice. I believe the arts should be federally funded. I believe climate change is real and that it's morally irresponsible to ignore it. We must work on a global scale to fix it. I believe anyone who doesn't believe in climate change looks as foolish as someone who believes the moon is made of cheese. I believe our education system is broken, but that every child deserves a quality education 100% free. That includes college. Education should be about knowledge, not profit. I believe that no American should worry about how to pay their medical bills, let alone die from being unable to afford the medicine they need. I believe mental health needs to be distigmatized.  I believe in legalizing marijuana. I believe our criminal justice system is unfairly persecuting minorities and keeping them in poverty in order to make a profit. I believe in sweeping and extensive gun control regulations. I do not believe in expanding our military. I don't believe in open borders, but I believe that anyone who wants to come to this country seeking asylum or to have a better life should be given the opportunity to do so. We've got plenty of room. I believe in Obama's tan suit. I believe in gay marriage and trans rights. Equal rights do not come with caveats.  I believe we should tax the rich. Those with more should be obligated to give more back. There's something, I don't know, Christian about it. I believe corporations held unchecked make life miserable for everyone. I believe that willful ignorance and fear are the biggest threats we face. No one even tries to understand things anymore and it bothers me. People would rather pick up a pitchfork than sit down for a cup of tea.  Most other 1st world countries have figured most of this out. To say things are ""impossible"" or will ""ruin us"" is simply naive. Sure, no country is perfect, and no system is perfect, but to look beyond the American Bubble is to see that America is far from the greatest country in the world, but we have the potential.  You want a better America? We have to better ourselves. And that includes wanting what's best for your neighbor. Selfish arrogance and willful blindness to anything beyond your white picket fence is why America isn't great. We have to learn compromise. We have to see things as they are (not as they were or how we hope they will be). We have to think as a nation, not as individuals. Not everything is about you. Disagree with me all you want, but if you're going to do so - don't make yourself look like a fool. The moon is not made of cheese.",4,4,,,,,,,1066667730192193,/story.php?story_fbid=1066667730192193&id=237033019822339
