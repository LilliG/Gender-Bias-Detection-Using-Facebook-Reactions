Reverend Raphael Warnock,,2020-01-30 07:07:51,"Growing up in public housing in Savannah, I learned from my parents the power of faith, love, and hard work. Those values brought me all the way Dr. King’s pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church where I now preside as Senior Pastor. I’ve spent my whole life trying to be ready to serve and to help people. But the concerns of Georgians have been ignored by a Washington that cares more about power and profits than the well-being of hard working families. That’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate -- to fight for Georgia families, defend the dignity of working people and to make sure ALL voices are heard. Are you ready?
