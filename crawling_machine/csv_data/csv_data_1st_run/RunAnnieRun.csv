"Annie ""Mam√°"" Garcia for U.S. Senate",,2020-02-14 13:10:35,"On Sunday, I will begin my westward journey, in search of a better life for all of us, and one without John Cornyn. Here's a layout of each city I will visit and get in touch with the voters of #Texas. Each day will consist of an Outrage of the Day (#OOTD), and I will talk honestly about the problems facing us and how we can overcome them. Something special is happening. Two weeks ago, I never would have believed that I would be in a statistical dead heat with someone who has been campaigning for the last two years. But this isn‚Äôt about me. It is about us. As just 1 person, I can‚Äôt highhandedly protect abortion rights, pass comprehensive immigration reform or even save just one life from gun violence. But together we can. This is the first step- electing someone who has a vision for our country that isn‚Äôt compromised by money, who wants to build a #Democratic party that has the moral clarity and political courage to inspire, and who will fight like hell for we the people. Join me on my walk. Engage on our Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages, @anniemamagarcia. Come to an event. Tell someone else about our campaign. And if you able, please consider donating. I believe I can win this primary for 1% of what other candidates have spent, and that alone would change conventional wisdom on who can run. But I can‚Äôt do it for free. And I appreciate every dollar that you can spare. Visit my website, RunAnnieRun.com, for more information or to make a donation to the campaign! ¬°Hasta pronto y adelante!

"Annie ""Mam√°"" Garcia for U.S. Senate,Annie Garcia",Annie Garcia,2020-02-11 04:45:48,"I remember when I posted this, 2 1/2 years ago when they tried to repeal the ACA. Should have answered their phones.Dear Senator Cruz, I have tried calling your DC office 19 times. Not once have I spoken to a live person, 3 times I left a voicemail and 16 times your voicemail box was full. Never has a message been returned. I can recite your voicemail message now by memory. I take you at your word that you ‚Äúlook forward to hearing‚Äù my ‚Äúthoughts and comments‚Äù. That‚Äôs why I am taking to a broader platform- with the hopes that you will hear Ari‚Äôs story, and maybe it will make a difference. My daughter Ari was born Tuesday, June 17, 2014. She was a beautiful baby- little, but feisty. Her brother Hugo was 16 months old when she was born, and we had our hands full, but were happy to have a son and daughter. The morning of July 27th, after a restless night, Ari struggled mightily to breath. My husband and I both have allergies, and we thought that perhaps she had inherited the same unfortunate gene, but after a few hours, as her cries turned to whimpers, we became alarmed. I raced her to the ER, not knowing what could be wrong, and still convinced that it was something minor. It‚Äôs funny how certain details stick in your memory. I remember the stillness of an entire hospital staff when I entered the triage area, and the burst of activity after they too heard her mewing. The anxiety in the doctor‚Äôs voice, as she grilled me about Ari‚Äôs eating habits. The look in their eyes when they determined Ari had some sort of heart condition. And the space they gave me to kiss her hands through the incubator and instruct her to be strong, before they transferred her to another hospital, as if it could be the last time she would hear me. When we arrived at the other hospital, it felt like an eternity, waiting to find out whether she had made it. The reassurance in no news eventually gave way to increasing terror, and finally my husband braved the ‚ÄúDo Not Enter‚Äù sign on the doors to find out whether she was alive. The doctors that followed him back out into the waiting room looked weirdly relieved, and for a sweet second I physically felt my body relax as relief flooded me. Then one doctor turned to the other, and I could hear her say ‚ÄúAt least they still have one child‚Äù. Immediately I felt my heart drop like a brick down to my bladder. Ari was born with an undiagnosed congenital heart defect called Transposition of the Great Arteries. For those first 6 weeks of her life, her body and brain were slowly suffocating, as the only means for getting oxygen- a tiny hole in her heart- closed. By the grace of God and the incredible skills of her pediatric cardiac team, Ari survived. She would undergo an emergency septectomy, 2 open-heart surgeries, a bout of sepsis, and 12 weeks in the ICU, but our tough, feisty baby girl made it- at least for now. Senator Cruz, I have diligently been calling your office these last two weeks because health care isn‚Äôt theoretical for my family. As the survivor of a pre-existing condition, Ari requires life-long medical treatment. And I worry that, though she survived this devastating diagnosis, she might not live her fullest life because her access to ongoing treatment will be denied. I am calling you because I hear that insurance companies- even ones that provide plans through employers, like my husband‚Äôs- could decide to put lifetime caps on medical expenses. Or what would happen if he lost his job? He works in oil and gas here in Houston, and with the price per barrel being what it is, every family in the industry worries. Senator Cruz, the cost to save Ari‚Äôs life was over $1,000,000. If it had been $200,000 out-of-pocket, it still would have been out of our reach. Did you know that of the 2,000,000 personal bankruptcies filed every year, 60% are due to medical bills? And of those 1,2000,000 medical bankruptcies, 900,000 had insurance? And bankruptcy is the preferable alternative. Figures vary as to how many people die due to lack of health insurance or access to healthcare, but common sense says that it does happen. Senator Cruz, as a Christian, I ask you to reflect on Matthew 25:31-46. I call you ever day because I want to ask you, how are you going to treat my daughter and the other Texans like her, the least of these? Respectfully, Anne Garcia",12,9,,3,,,,1,135652961258384,/story.php?story_fbid=135652961258384&id=107413274082353
