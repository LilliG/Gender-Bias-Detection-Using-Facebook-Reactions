"James Mackler,Highlander Center",,2019-04-02 10:16:50,"Sickened to hear about this. White supremacists must be called what they are and those that committed acts of violence must be brought to justice.It‚Äôs time for our people to hear more from us. What we know: As most of you know, a devastating fire burned down our main office early Friday morning. Thankfully no one was inside the building and no one was injured.  We also found a symbol connected to the white power movement spray-painted on the parking lot connected to the main office.  While we do not know the names of the culprits, we know that the white power movement has been increasing and consolidating power across the South, across this nation, and globally. Since 2016, the white power movement has become more visible, and we‚Äôve seen that manifest in various ways, both subtle and overt. They‚Äôve targeted and exploited working class and cash-poor white communities searching to find a sense of belonging, dividing them from people who support efforts to improve the material conditions of all people. Their attempts to increase in size and scale impact the realities of our daily lives here because the majority of Black people in this country reside in southern states. As islamophobic attacks become more prevalent, we‚Äôre hyper-aware that the majority of Muslims in this nation are Black people. We know that anti-Semitic attacks have rocked the Jewish community. We know that anti-immigrant forces are consolidating, attacks on reproductive freedoms abound and the politics of the federal government‚Äôs executive branch are speaking to the privilege-based fears of the white power movement, emboldening them in ways the 21st century hasn‚Äôt seen. Even in the face of these realities, the southern freedom movement is alive and well. Our folks are winning campaigns. They‚Äôre organizing and base building. People are fighting for progressive policies and using direct action to hold people in power accountable. Highlander is a sacred place built by communities of the most affected people and it has become a home to those who believe in freedom and collective liberation here in the south, across the U.S and around the world. Because of our history we are not surprised that this space, one where marginalized people working across sectors, geographies and identities show up consistently, has been repeatedly targeted over our 87 years of existence.  What‚Äôs next: The safety of our people is and has always been our first concern. The investigation is nowhere near over. We are continuing to survive and monitor the process that takes more time in a rural geography with limited public resources. The Jefferson County Sheriff‚Äôs Office will continue their investigation. The Tennessee Bomb and Arson people will continue to do theirs. We are not confused about how rarely people are ever charged with arson; however, we are surviving and monitoring these investigations. This is a time for building our power. Now is the time to be vigilant. To love each other and support each other and to keep each other safe in turbulent times. Now is not the time to dismiss how scary things are, which makes it even more important to have concrete assessments of concrete conditions, and sophisticated strategies to build a new world. What‚Äôs next for Highlander is that we will continue to be that sacred place, that movement home, that place where strategy is developed, that place where principled struggle happens, that place that accompanies movement, that place that incubates radical work, and that place that demands transformative justice.   We love you all, we appreciate your patience and questions, and please continue to be vigilant.",72,20,,1,,34,17,,598696407311791,/story.php?story_fbid=598696407311791&id=193899114458191

If you agree sign your name and stand with Tennessee women >>> https://www.jamesmackler.com/landing/e190308/ #tnsenI am truly saddened to know my colleagues have voted to take away my rights to control my body and ability to access abortion services. We need to affirm a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to make her own decisions about abortion. HB 77 seeks to control women‚Äôs reproductive freedom and oppress women and their communities. Access to abortion cannot be separated from human rights.  This bill seeks ton ban abortion as early as 6 weeks into a pregnancy. many women do not know they are pregnant at the time. This bill endanger‚Äôs women‚Äôs health and lives by interfering with a doctor‚Äôs ability to treat a pregnant patient. Not every woman has the capacity to be a mother and to deny her a right to an abortion and potentially put her physical, mental and emotional health at risk is not pro-life, it‚Äôs pro-birth. This pro-birth agenda by HB77 supporters is inhumane and irresponsible. First, this state needs to do more to protect women‚Äôs access to healthcare and healthcare services, access to a fully funded education system, access to housing and food and equity in the workplace before we can force a woman to have babies. The pro-life movement is not concerned about the well-being of the mother before, during or after pregnancy, they are simply obsessed with women pushing out babies.  Secondly, Rape and incest are inhumane. No woman should have to carry her rapist child. Not only would this cause the woman to seek illegal and unhealthy means to get rid of the child, but you also will mentally and emotionally harm the woman and child. This could lead to more children in foster care or on the street. Creating additional issues for the state. For rapists with pro-birth fantasies, HB77 will empower these individuals to act on this and make women bear this injustice. As an advocate for reducing sex trafficking, we will offer less protections for these victims by making them carry the sins of their perpetrators. Why are we allowing rapists to have a free pass on women???  This bill is unconstitutional and fiscally irresponsible!! For a state that brags about being fiscally conservative, this bill would drag the state into legal fights that would costs tax payers tons of money.  No man should be making complete decisions about a woman‚Äôs body. Men do not carry children and they should not have the power to control a woman‚Äôs body and her right to keep or terminate a pregnancy.  Finally, for a state who believes in ‚Äúlimited government‚Äù, this bill is using government to intervene in the lives of women, their families, and their doctors.
