You see, Industrialized Agriculture was ‚Äúsold‚Äù to our farmers (and us) as a technological miracle that would speed up production and out produce natural organic farming in both quality and quantity...fast forward a little more than 100 years from its conception - 100+ years of chemically removing natural nutrients in our soil (we get our proper micronutrients from the soil in which our plant crops are grown - our strong and healthy immune system requires these for optimal performance).  As you can see, the heavy use of these chemicals has resulted in crops that are not as fruitful in quality or quantity.   Both pictured below are products grown in the USA.  The organic farmer here has been farming organically for a very long period, as shown by the size and beauty of the harvest!

Elizabeth McLeod for Senate,,2020-04-16 18:36:41,"THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN LEGEND:  ERIN GRUWELL ‚ÄúThe Promise of America‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe American Dream‚Äù - there are simply no other words to justifiably articulate the mission and vision of the United States.  The mission is her promise: that we are all uniquely individual, yet individually we are equally free.  The vision is her dream:  Uniquely individual, we are equally free to pursue our own dream.  Because we are uniquely individual, not every individual‚Äôs dream is achieved by measure of profit or wealth.  For Erin Gruwell, achieving her American Dream is measured by the impact she had on others.   Like her father, Erin had a deep passion for fighting for equality and defending the underdog.  In 1992, Erin was in college working towards an education major before heading to law school.  However, after watching the Los Angeles Riots that year, she opted to focus solely on her education degree.  She recalled her reaction to the riots in the Freedom Writers Diaries:  ‚ÄúI thought, God, by the time you‚Äôre defending a kid in the courtroom, the battle‚Äôs already lost.  I think that the real fighting should happen in the classroom.‚Äù Against the odd:  There‚Äôs way too many for a written list to give them justice.  Watch the movie.  It's very accurate and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I promise. Ironically, in achieving her American Dream, Erin‚Äôs mission was to bring ‚ÄúThe Promise of America‚Äù to the forefront in a school district that had been overcome by the mainstream‚Äôs idea that the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù wasn‚Äôt meant for every American.   ‚ÄúIt would be easy to become a victim of our circumstances and continue feeling sad, scared or angry; instead, we could choose to deal with the injustice humanely and break the chains of negative thoughts and energies, and not let ourselves sink into it.‚Äù - Erin Gruwell",1,1,,,,,,,148669920022722,/story.php?story_fbid=148669920022722&id=110815393808175

Elizabeth McLeod for Senate,,2020-04-14 15:05:47,"‚ÄúThough I was born in Israel, I can tell you that it‚Äôs America that has become the Promised Land.  Not just for me, but for people of all walks of life, all skin colors, and all nationalities.  I will be forever indebted to this country for allowing me to breathe free, dream big, and achieve anything I ever imagined I could.‚Äù ‚Äì Gene Simmons, ‚ÄúMe, Inc.‚Äù THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN LEGEND:  GENE SIMMONS Loud and Proud, it's easy to label Gene Simmons as an egotistical and self-absorbed jerk in a rock band ‚Äì BUT, taking a deeper look into the lesser known real-life story of Gene Simmons, we find the Promise of America is not dead.  Let‚Äôs take a look at Gene‚Äôs successfully achieving his own ‚ÄúAmerican Dream.‚Äù Against all odds:  The son of Hungarian refugees, both Nazi concentration camp survivors, Simmons was born in Israel shortly after his parents took refuge in the newly sovereign state.  While still a young boy, Simmons‚Äô father walked out on the family.  Life in Israel during that time was hard:  their one-bedroom apartment adorned with bullet holes, the decorative reminders of the never-ending conflict of the region; food was rationed ‚Äì you got what they gave and food was in short supply; no toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, etc.  It was at this very young age that Simmons learned the valuable lesson that you are the only person that you can depend on ‚Äì it‚Äôs up to you to provide for yourself. Not able to speak a lick of English, Simmons stepped on American soil for the first time as a young 8.5-year-old boy ‚Äì DID YOU CATCH THAT?  Have you heard Simmons talk (watch the video below)‚Ä¶would you have guessed English was not his first language, and he didn‚Äôt even learn to speak one word of English until almost 9 years of age?  Hebrew is his first and native language...‚ÄúWhat are you, Stupid?‚Äù the ridicule of the American children was motivation enough to learn English and drop any signs of an accent. The heart of an entrepreneur, Simmons would work his entire life to achieve more and more. Simmons worked throughout his childhood and college years - his earnings would help his mother with the living expenses and  pay for his college education (a bachelors degree in education).  By the time he partnered with Paul Stanley to form Wicked Lester, he had amassed a savings of nearly $23,000 (value reflects dollar amount of the time, not today).  This nest egg would allow the two to self-fund the making of a legendary band we all know as KISS.  The success of KISS does not start here ‚Äì there was constant struggle and overcoming ‚Äì but Simmons never gave up and KISS will forever be an iconic original rock band.  Though, Simmons has often stated that KISS isn‚Äôt a band, it‚Äôs a brand ‚Äì a business that just happens to play musical instruments and sings.   Simmons is widely praised as a genius businessman, and I agree.  If you are looking for a good swift platform booted kick in the rear, I highly recommend his book, ‚ÄúMe, Inc.‚Äù  I was first in line to purchase the book as soon as it hit the shelves ‚Äì it was what I needed at the time I needed it most.  You see, I had fallen into the lies being sold in the mainstream‚Ä¶it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a female that I didn‚Äôt get that promotion/raise, which wasn‚Äôt necessarily untrue, but it wasn‚Äôt how I had ever looked at life.  In the few months after ‚ÄúMe, Inc.,‚Äù I made it so that it was impossible for me not to get that promotion/raise ‚Äì if you think you are where you are because of someone else, you will always stay where you are.   Like all great American Legends, Simmons also shares how important it is to be charitable and take care of others with the success you have gained.  Most don‚Äôt know his humanitarianism‚Ä¶check it out for yourself ‚Äì you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised.

Elizabeth McLeod for Senate,,2020-04-16 18:36:41,"THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN LEGEND:  ERIN GRUWELL ‚ÄúThe Promise of America‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe American Dream‚Äù - there are simply no other words to justifiably articulate the mission and vision of the United States.  The mission is her promise: that we are all uniquely individual, yet individually we are equally free.  The vision is her dream:  Uniquely individual, we are equally free to pursue our own dream.  Because we are uniquely individual, not every individual‚Äôs dream is achieved by measure of profit or wealth.  For Erin Gruwell, achieving her American Dream is measured by the impact she had on others.   Like her father, Erin had a deep passion for fighting for equality and defending the underdog.  In 1992, Erin was in college working towards an education major before heading to law school.  However, after watching the Los Angeles Riots that year, she opted to focus solely on her education degree.  She recalled her reaction to the riots in the Freedom Writers Diaries:  ‚ÄúI thought, God, by the time you‚Äôre defending a kid in the courtroom, the battle‚Äôs already lost.  I think that the real fighting should happen in the classroom.‚Äù Against the odd:  There‚Äôs way too many for a written list to give them justice.  Watch the movie.  It's very accurate and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I promise. Ironically, in achieving her American Dream, Erin‚Äôs mission was to bring ‚ÄúThe Promise of America‚Äù to the forefront in a school district that had been overcome by the mainstream‚Äôs idea that the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù wasn‚Äôt meant for every American.   ‚ÄúIt would be easy to become a victim of our circumstances and continue feeling sad, scared or angry; instead, we could choose to deal with the injustice humanely and break the chains of negative thoughts and energies, and not let ourselves sink into it.‚Äù - Erin Gruwell",1,1,,,,,,,148669920022722,/story.php?story_fbid=148669920022722&id=110815393808175

Elizabeth McLeod for Senate,,2020-04-14 15:05:47,"‚ÄúThough I was born in Israel, I can tell you that it‚Äôs America that has become the Promised Land.  Not just for me, but for people of all walks of life, all skin colors, and all nationalities.  I will be forever indebted to this country for allowing me to breathe free, dream big, and achieve anything I ever imagined I could.‚Äù ‚Äì Gene Simmons, ‚ÄúMe, Inc.‚Äù THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN LEGEND:  GENE SIMMONS Loud and Proud, it's easy to label Gene Simmons as an egotistical and self-absorbed jerk in a rock band ‚Äì BUT, taking a deeper look into the lesser known real-life story of Gene Simmons, we find the Promise of America is not dead.  Let‚Äôs take a look at Gene‚Äôs successfully achieving his own ‚ÄúAmerican Dream.‚Äù Against all odds:  The son of Hungarian refugees, both Nazi concentration camp survivors, Simmons was born in Israel shortly after his parents took refuge in the newly sovereign state.  While still a young boy, Simmons‚Äô father walked out on the family.  Life in Israel during that time was hard:  their one-bedroom apartment adorned with bullet holes, the decorative reminders of the never-ending conflict of the region; food was rationed ‚Äì you got what they gave and food was in short supply; no toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, etc.  It was at this very young age that Simmons learned the valuable lesson that you are the only person that you can depend on ‚Äì it‚Äôs up to you to provide for yourself. Not able to speak a lick of English, Simmons stepped on American soil for the first time as a young 8.5-year-old boy ‚Äì DID YOU CATCH THAT?  Have you heard Simmons talk (watch the video below)‚Ä¶would you have guessed English was not his first language, and he didn‚Äôt even learn to speak one word of English until almost 9 years of age?  Hebrew is his first and native language...‚ÄúWhat are you, Stupid?‚Äù the ridicule of the American children was motivation enough to learn English and drop any signs of an accent. The heart of an entrepreneur, Simmons would work his entire life to achieve more and more. Simmons worked throughout his childhood and college years - his earnings would help his mother with the living expenses and  pay for his college education (a bachelors degree in education).  By the time he partnered with Paul Stanley to form Wicked Lester, he had amassed a savings of nearly $23,000 (value reflects dollar amount of the time, not today).  This nest egg would allow the two to self-fund the making of a legendary band we all know as KISS.  The success of KISS does not start here ‚Äì there was constant struggle and overcoming ‚Äì but Simmons never gave up and KISS will forever be an iconic original rock band.  Though, Simmons has often stated that KISS isn‚Äôt a band, it‚Äôs a brand ‚Äì a business that just happens to play musical instruments and sings.   Simmons is widely praised as a genius businessman, and I agree.  If you are looking for a good swift platform booted kick in the rear, I highly recommend his book, ‚ÄúMe, Inc.‚Äù  I was first in line to purchase the book as soon as it hit the shelves ‚Äì it was what I needed at the time I needed it most.  You see, I had fallen into the lies being sold in the mainstream‚Ä¶it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a female that I didn‚Äôt get that promotion/raise, which wasn‚Äôt necessarily untrue, but it wasn‚Äôt how I had ever looked at life.  In the few months after ‚ÄúMe, Inc.,‚Äù I made it so that it was impossible for me not to get that promotion/raise ‚Äì if you think you are where you are because of someone else, you will always stay where you are.   Like all great American Legends, Simmons also shares how important it is to be charitable and take care of others with the success you have gained.  Most don‚Äôt know his humanitarianism‚Ä¶check it out for yourself ‚Äì you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised.

Elizabeth McLeod for Senate,,2020-04-04 21:20:17,"Knowledge is power:  When a Politician brags about ‚ÄúIncentivizing‚Äù through ‚ÄúSubsidizing‚Äù‚Ä¶it really means the Federal Government is paying for, with your hard-earned tax dollars, the action in which they are trying to ‚Äúincentivize.‚Äù  This Bill is a prime example of the abuse that the American Taxpayer‚Äôs have had to endure for years ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to stop the bleeding madness. This bill does nothing to ‚Äúincentivize‚Äù the repatriation of the Pharmaceutical Preparations Industry ‚Äì you know, that hiccup we have in our pharmaceutical supply-chain?  The one where our Great American Pharmaceutical Companies have setup production facilities in China‚Ä¶yep, nothing in this bill brings those back to U.S. soil. However, this bill does: 1 - Expand the Federal Government, specifically the FDA ‚Äì the same group that is morally and ethically challenged and married to Big Pharma (How many times has the FDA approved complete poison and refuses to pull it from the market‚Ä¶ahem, Opioids, Aspartame, and Accutane). 2 - Creates ‚ÄúNational Centers of Excellence in Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing‚Äù or a more appropriate name would be ‚ÄúNational Continuance of Excellently Advancing the Worth of Pharmaceuticals at the Expense of the American Taxpayer‚Äôs Health and Wealth.‚Äù 3 - Subsidizes (pays for) the educational programs of Big Pharma‚Äôs future workforce ‚Äì i.e., students that attend these higher education institutions that are ‚ÄúNational Centers of Excellence in Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing‚Äù 4 - Cost, at face value, $100,000,000 American Tax Dollars.   5 - Increases our National Debt - Because the federal government is broke it will have to borrow money, most likely from China, to fund this Bill that does nothing to solve our problems.   At the end of the day, American Pharmaceutical Companies will still have their manufacturing facilities in China, the American Taxpayer will have funded these higher educational programs whose students are the future workforce for Big Pharma, and we will have paid China for servicing the debt that got us nowhere.",1,,,,,,1,,144230070466707,/story.php?story_fbid=144230070466707&id=110815393808175
