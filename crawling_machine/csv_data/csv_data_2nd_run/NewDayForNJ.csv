"Tricia Flanagan for U.S. Senate,Deborah Balog",,2020-03-29 17:32:34,"So much wisdom.. younger generations have no idea.. Less we forget… I talked with a man today, an 80+-year-old man. I asked him if there was anything I can get him while this Coronavirus scare was gripping America. He simply smiled, looked away and said: ""Let me tell you what I need! I need to believe, at some point, this country my generation fought for... I need to believe this nation we handed safely to our children and their children... I need to know this generation will quit being a bunch of sissies...that they respect what they've been given...that they've earned what others sacrificed for."" I wasn't sure where the conversation was going or if it was going anywhere at all. So, I sat there, quietly observing. ""You know, I was a little boy during WWII. Those were scary days. We didn't know if we were going to be speaking English, German or Japanese at the end of the war. There was no certainty, no guarantees like Americans enjoy today. And no home went without sacrifice or loss. Every house, up and down every street, had someone in harm's way. Maybe their Daddy was a soldier, maybe their son was a sailor, maybe it was an uncle. Sometimes it was the whole damn family...fathers, sons, uncles... Having someone, you love, sent off to war...it wasn't less frightening than it is today. It was scary as Hell. If anything, it was more frightening. We didn't have battlefront news. We didn't have email or cellphones. You sent them away and you hoped...you prayed. You may not hear from them for months, if ever. Sometimes a mother was getting her son's letters the same day Dad was comforting her over their child's death. And we sacrificed. You couldn't buy things. Everything was rationed. You were only allowed so much milk per month, only so much bread, toilet paper. EVERYTHING was restricted for the war effort. And what you weren't using, what you didn't need, things you threw away, they were saved and sorted for the war effort. My generation was the original recycling movement in America. And we had viruses back then...serious viruses. Things like polio, measles, and such. It was nothing to walk to school and pass a house or two that was quarantined. We didn't shut down our schools. We didn't shut down our cities. We carried on, without masks, without hand sanitizer. And do you know what? We persevered. We overcame. We didn't attack our President, we came together. We rallied around the flag for the war. Thick or thin, we were in it to win. And we would lose more boys in an hour of combat than we lose in entire wars today."" He slowly looked away again. Maybe I saw a small tear in the corner of his eye. Then he continued: ""Today's kids don't know sacrifice. They think sacrifice is not having coverage on their phone while they freely drive across the country. Today's kids are selfish and spoiled. In my generation, we looked out for our elders. We helped out with single moms whose husbands were either at war or dead from war. Today's kids rush the store, buying everything they can...no concern for anyone but themselves. It's shameful the way Americans behave these days. None of them deserve the sacrifices their granddads made. So, no I don't need anything. I appreciate your offer but, I know I've been through worse things than this virus. But maybe I should be asking you, what can I do to help you? Do you have enough pop to get through this, enough steak? Will you be able to survive with 113 channels on your TV?"" I smiled, fighting back a tear of my own..now humbled by a man in his 80's. All I could do was thank him for the history lesson, leave my number for emergency and leave with my ego firmly tucked in my rear. I talked to a man today. A real man. An American man from an era long gone and forgotten. We will never understand the sacrifices. We will never fully earn their sacrifices. But we should work harder to learn about them.

This alone can restore our Rights, and restore sanity to our system of government. LET’S HOLD CONGRESS ACCOUNTABLE to restore our “inalienable” Right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness by sponsoring and passing the proposed “Civil Rights Act for Equal Educational Opportunity.” This will fix our broken education system by force of competition, while slashing costs by many billions annually. Despite decades of declining, grossly overpriced education, Congress has failed to deliver! TRAGICALLY, CONGRESS IS SUFFERING from Stockholm syndrome, a condition in which hostages develop a psychological alliance with their captors. The Progressive Deep State, that has gained control of most of our government, has all of Congress agreeing with Progressives that Congress has no authority to restore the right of parents to provide their children with quality education, without undue government intrusion. They refuse to sponsor this lifesaving legislation, which will also heal most of society’s ills, such as growing strife and crime. The 10th Amendment, they claim, leaves education to the states. But it does not authorize states to deny parental and taxpayer rights! CHANGE IS DESPERATELY NEEDED! Since we don’t have a cure for Stockholm syndrome, we need to elect those not so afflicted. There is an all-inclusive team of candidates now forming under the banner “Certified Constitutional Candidate,” committed to sponsor this bill as their first order of business. Meet them at www.c32020.org.

"Tricia Flanagan for U.S. Senate,Franklin Graham",,2020-03-14 07:04:29,"Our President has called for tomorrow—Sunday, March 15—to be a National Day of Prayer. I hope every church, regardless of denomination, and every individual, regardless of political affiliation, will pray and seek the Lord as our nation faces this crisis. President Donald J. Trump reminded the entire country that throughout its history, the United States has looked to God for strength and protection in times like these. The President is right—and we need to call on God now. We need to pray that He would protect us from this virus that is turning the world upside down and gripping the hearts of men and women with fear. The Bible teaches us to trust in God. In the Old Testament, Egypt was faced with 7 years of plenty and then 7 years of a drastic climate change where crops dried up and nothing grew. It was such a severe crisis that everyone could have died. But God sent Joseph to save not only his family, but all of Egypt. God provided. God also sent Jesus to save us. He is our Shepherd and our deliverer; and regardless of what storms we may face, He will be with us. This doesn’t mean that COVID-19 will disappear immediately; but the Word of God tells us that He loves us and will not leave us.  “Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand” (Isaiah 41:10). Will you join us in praying tomorrow? I encourage you to contact your family, your friends, church members you know, and ask them to be in prayer as well.",9,7,,2,,,,,3812589655448236,/story.php?story_fbid=3812589655448236&id=1981357038571516

Women were uniquely created to do what men cannot do. We are created physically, mentally, and emotionally perfect for our role in this world, and men need us to be just that: perfectly female. When God created Eve, He said that He would give Adam a help meet for him. (Meet: adjective; precisely adapted to a particular situation, need, or circumstance : very proper).  The world doesn’t need women who are trying to fulfill two roles. The world doesn’t need “equal” women. The world, our country, our homes need women to fulfill their role to the utmost. It’s not the lesser role: it’s a complimentary role.  Ladies, embrace your feminine role. Thank God for the special gifts you have. Embrace them.

"Tricia Flanagan for U.S. Senate,Tom Carbone",,2020-02-10 10:55:57,"No other President has done so much good with so little gratitude. We the People thank you, Mr. President! God bless President Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸- TRUMP DOES THE UNTHINKABLE. by Liz Crokin As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a Huge feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hardworking businessman. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse. Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of the acts of kindness he's committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears. In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill's family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill's pleas for help in news reports. In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief-stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn't hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment. In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones. In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: We've paid off your mortgage. In 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach , Florida, accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who as the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump put the light on Palm Beach not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination. Foxman also noted that Trump's charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks. In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl's story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check. In 2008, after Jennifer Hudson's family members were tragically murdered in Chicago , Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump's security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time. In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at the traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded. In 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tamoressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn't even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine's release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet. In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tearfully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days, she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she's the bravest woman, I know. She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college. Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he's a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she's struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through immensely difficult times. Donald Trump's kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race, and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help. Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he'd ever run for president. He said: ""If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country.'"" That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help. How unthinkable! On the other hand, have you ever heard of Hillary or Obama ever doing such things with their own resources? Now that's really unthinkable! Might be worth passing on!!! Just shows we hired the right guy. If Hollywood , the liberals and the media ever STOP harassing him, Trump will have time to do many more positive things for our country....the good ole United States of America!! PS ~ To those who are already Fact Checking, don't bother . . . already did it, and all the stories are TRUE! The Liberal, progressive, socialists want to destroy this guy. The same mindset crucified Jesus.",32,28,,4,,,,,3698969530143583,/story.php?story_fbid=3698969530143583&id=1981357038571516

"Tricia Flanagan for U.S. Senate,Tom Carbone",,2020-02-10 10:55:57,"No other President has done so much good with so little gratitude. We the People thank you, Mr. President! God bless President Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸- TRUMP DOES THE UNTHINKABLE. by Liz Crokin As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a Huge feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hardworking businessman. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse. Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of the acts of kindness he's committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears. In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill's family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill's pleas for help in news reports. In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief-stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn't hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment. In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones. In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: We've paid off your mortgage. In 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach , Florida, accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who as the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump put the light on Palm Beach not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination. Foxman also noted that Trump's charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks. In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl's story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check. In 2008, after Jennifer Hudson's family members were tragically murdered in Chicago , Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump's security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time. In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at the traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded. In 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tamoressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn't even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine's release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet. In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tearfully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days, she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she's the bravest woman, I know. She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college. Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he's a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she's struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through immensely difficult times. Donald Trump's kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race, and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help. Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he'd ever run for president. He said: ""If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country.'"" That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help. How unthinkable! On the other hand, have you ever heard of Hillary or Obama ever doing such things with their own resources? Now that's really unthinkable! Might be worth passing on!!! Just shows we hired the right guy. If Hollywood , the liberals and the media ever STOP harassing him, Trump will have time to do many more positive things for our country....the good ole United States of America!! PS ~ To those who are already Fact Checking, don't bother . . . already did it, and all the stories are TRUE! The Liberal, progressive, socialists want to destroy this guy. The same mindset crucified Jesus.",32,28,,4,,,,,3698969530143583,/story.php?story_fbid=3698969530143583&id=1981357038571516
