Things you can do: 1) Shop online or via phone. While some stores already have online shopping, others will help customers order via phone or FaceTime. (Laramie's Basecamp has set a great example for local businesses.)  2) If you typically use local businesses to fill wholesale orders, place those requests as soon as possible. 3) Buy gift cards to use at a later date to support businesses now, even if you don't currently need anything. 4) Order takeout or delivery and tip the same amount as you would dining in.",4,4,,,,,,,139210170933435,/story.php?story_fbid=139210170933435&id=112903096897476

Ben-David U.S. Senate 2020,,2020-03-03 19:35:00,"You may be wondering why I say climate change will hit Wyoming's economy the hardest. The technology to replace coal, oil, and gas with alternative energy sources is advancing in leaps and bounds across much of the planet. When the price of coal, oil, and gas declines below the cost of production, this sector will wane, along with the bulk of Wyoming’s revenue. We are watching the beginning as coal mines and coal-fired power plants are closing and our communities are losing residents and loved ones. These are issues that matter to me, a Wyomingite.
