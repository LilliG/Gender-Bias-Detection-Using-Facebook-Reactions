Ed Markey,,2020-04-08 11:27:18,"I am saddened to learn that Boston Pride has been postponed this year. Although this feels like losing important visibility and a much needed source of joy, it is necessary to protect the health and safety of the LGBTQ+ community during this global health crisis. I am inspired by the persistence of LGBTQ+ activists who are working to move celebrations online to curb the spread of COVID-19. Although we cannot physically celebrate together, we can and should find alternate ways to celebrate this incredibly important movement. I wanted to touch on some of the reasons that we celebrate Pride and why it is important that we continue to protect the LGBTQ+ community. We celebrate Pride to honor the history of the LGBTQ+ community, to remember the activists who lost their lives in the fight for liberation, and to ensure that no one faces discrimination because of their sexuality or gender identity. Dangerous legislation like the Defense of Marriage Act and the policy of Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell have harmed the basic rights of LGBTQ+ people. I‚Äôm proud to have fought against these policies for decades and to have co-authored the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act. In order to keep the spirit of Pride alive every day, we must remember those who came before us in this fight and stand with the LGBTQ+ community for justice, equal rights, and the guarantee that all people are allowed to be who they are and love who they love without fear. I am excited to celebrate Pride with you all both digitally and when we are all able to convene together.",73,46,,12,,15,,,2271595259610795,/story.php?story_fbid=2271595259610795&id=303167829786891
