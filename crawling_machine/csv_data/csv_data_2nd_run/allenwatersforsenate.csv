Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,,2020-05-02 01:45:46,"Of course, when you wear a mask you are much more likely to touch your face taking your mask on and off, and adjusting it. So, wearing a mask probably increases your risk of catching Coronavirus. But, for Governors like Raimondo and Baker it's all about control. They can't prevent people from dying, but they can prevent people from living. And, they are doing just that. If maybe 99.5% of people who are infected with Coronavirus will live, how can we cure ourselves of tyrannical Governors? Governors Gina Raimondo and Charlie Baker are way more dangerous to the people than Coronavirus. I am 64, and in elementary school, I missed having to get under my desk to protect me from a nuclear blast.

"Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,Rhode Island Republican Party",,2020-04-28 08:25:37,"Case Dismissed. RI Democrat Trickle Down Economics.The Rhode Island Ethics Commission will decide behind closed doors on Tuesday whether to hold the equivalent of a trial into allegations that Governor Gina Raimondo crossed a line when she negotiated a no-bid, 20-year Lottery deal with International Game Technology. The complaint the state GOP filed against Democrat Raimondo centers on her relationship with former IGT Chairman Donald Sweitzer, who was both an IGT lobbyist in Rhode Island and treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association while Raimondo led the group. The complaint, filed by GOP lawyer Brandon Bell in July 2019, alleges that Raimondo violated the prohibition against public officials using their public positions to benefit a “business associate,″ in this case Sweitzer. The agenda for the Ethics Commission’s remote meeting signals the commission’s intent to discuss - and take a critical vote - on the complaint behind closed doors. Asked if that means the staff investigation is complete and the full commission is now ready to vote on whether there is “probable cause″ to proceed with the equivalent of a trial, Executive Director Jason Gramitt told The Journal: “Yes, the investigation is completed. Tuesday will be a probable cause hearing in executive session. “The Commission will review the Investigative Report and determine whether there is probable cause to believe that there was a knowing and willful violation.

"Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,Walter E. Williams",,2020-04-27 14:52:46,"I concur.Today's Americans and Yesteryear's Americans By Walter E.Williams      April 28, 2020 Dr. Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a military historian and a professor emeritus of classics at California State University, Fresno. He has written two articles relevant to today's society. Last October he published, ""Members of Previous Generations Now Seem Like Giants,"" and he recently wrote, ""Is America a Roaring Giant or Crying Baby?""  In the first article, Hanson starts with some observations and questions regarding the greatness of previous generations compared with today's Americans. He asks: ""Does anyone believe that contemporary Americans could build another transcontinental railroad in six years? ... America went to the moon in 1969 with supposedly primitive computers and backward engineering. Does anyone believe we could launch a similar moonshot today?"" Hanson observes: ""We have been fighting in Afghanistan without result for 18 years. Our forefathers helped to win World War II and defeat the Axis Powers in four years."" Keep in mind that the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy) had far greater firepower than the Afghan rebels that we've fought. Hanson also could have asked whether today's Americans could build a 1,700-mile road such as the ALCAN Highway, connecting the lower 48 states to Alaska, whose construction started in March 1942 and was completed in October that year. In terms of learning, Hanson asks whether anyone believes that a 2020 college graduate knows half of what a 1950 graduate knew. In the 1940s, he says, young people read the works of William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pearl Buck and John Steinbeck. He doubts that today's high school graduates could even finish ""The Good Earth"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath."" I attended Benjamin Franklin High School from 1950 to 1954, and our senior English class required reading included Geoffrey Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"" and William Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" and ""Julius Caesar."" By the way, when I attended Benjamin Franklin High, it was ranked the lowest among Philadelphia's high schools. Hanson's second article asks whether our response to the COVID-19 epidemic will be that of a ""roaring giant"" or ""crying baby."" We can awaken, just as we did on Dec. 8, 1941, with massive amounts of fight, ready to get on a war footing. For those who were not around then or do not know our history, in 1941 our nation had seven fleet aircraft carriers and one escort carrier. By 1945, it was deploying 27 fleet and 72 escort carriers. In December 1941, we had 2.2 million service members in the U.S. military. By the war's end, there were more than 12 million Americans in the armed services. That's an astonishing mobilization considering our population was a little over 132 million. What's even more amazing is that our gross domestic product for 1944 exceeded the combined economic output of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy and Germany. Hanson says that our other choice regarding the epidemic is whether to continue the partisan bickering and blaming. We can ignore the importance of the crisis and instead scapegoat and play the blame game. We can talk not of an America in crisis but of the virus's effects on particular groups. We can decide that to hold China responsible for lying about the virus is mean, racist and, at best, xenophobic. In other words, Hanson says, ""The choice is ours whether America awakens as a roaring giant or a crying baby."" My prediction is that Americans, left to their own tendencies, will roar together as giants and will ignore the political and media crybabies. Walter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason University.",15,13,,2,,,,,2637695033219436,/story.php?story_fbid=2637695033219436&id=1527563887565895

"Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,Walter E. Williams",,2020-04-20 14:12:55,"https://www.facebook.com/215204795235779/posts/2865919240164308/Benefits vs. Costs and COVID-19 By Walter E.Williams    April 21, 2020 One of the first lessons in an economics class is everything has a cost. That's in stark contrast to lessons in the political arena where politicians talk about free stuff. In our personal lives, decision-making involves weighing costs against benefits. Businessmen make the same calculation if they want to stay in business. It's an entirely different story for politicians running the government where any benefit, however minuscule, is often deemed to be worth any cost, however large. Related to decision-making is the issue of being overly safe versus not safe enough. Sometimes, being as safe as one can be is worthless. A minor example: How many of us before driving our cars inspect the hydraulic brake system for damage? We'd be safer if we did, but most of us just assume everything is OK and get into our car and drive away. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of highway fatalities. Virtually all those lives could be saved with a mandated 5 mph speed limit. Fortunately, we consider costs and rightfully conclude that saving those 40,000 lives aren't worth the costs and inconvenience of a 5 mph mandate. With the costs and benefits in mind, we might examine our government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first thing to keep in mind about any crisis, be it war, natural disasters or pandemics, is we should keep markets open and private incentives strong. Markets solve problems because they provide the right incentives to use resources effectively. Federal, state and local governments have ordered an unprecedented and disastrous shutdown of much of the U.S. economy in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. There's a strictly health-related downside to the shutdown of the U.S. economy ignored by our leadership that has been argued by epidemiologist Dr. Knut Wittkowski, formerly the head of the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at Rockefeller University in New York City. Wittkowski argues that the lockdown prolongs the development of the ""herd immunity,"" which is our only weapon in ""exterminating"" the novel coronavirus — outside of a vaccine that's going to optimistically take 18 months or more to produce. He says we should focus on shielding the elderly and people with comorbidities while allowing the young and healthy to associate with one another in order to build up immunities. Wittkowski says, ""So, it's very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated."" Herd immunity, Wittkowski argues, would stop a ""second wave"" headed for the United States in the fall. Dr. David L. Katz, president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, shares Wittkowski's vision. Writing in The New York Times, he argued that our fight against COVID-19 could be worse than the virus itself. The bottom line is that costs can be concealed but not eliminated. Moreover, if people only look at the benefits from a particular course of action, they will do just about anything, because everything has a benefit. Political hustlers and demagogues love promising benefits when the costs can easily be concealed. By the way, the best time to be wrong and persist in being wrong is when the costs of being wrong are borne by others. The absolute worst part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and possibly its most unrecoverable damage, is the massive power that Americans have given to their federal, state and local governments to regulate our lives in the name of protecting our health. Taking back that power should be the most urgent component of our recovery efforts. It's going to be challenging; once a politician, and his bureaucracy, gains power, he will fight tooth and nail to keep it. Walter E.

Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,,2020-04-19 06:30:42,"Senator Jack Reed and his Congressional Democrats will destroy us to destroy Trump. ""Moving the Shutdown Goal Posts"" Liberals try to set Trump up to take the blame for any further coronavirus deaths. By Kimberley A. Strassel, WSJ, April 16, 2020 The shutdown came. The shutdown conquered. Long live the shutdown. That’s the line congressional Democrats and liberal journalists are now adopting, as they set new battle lines in the pandemic debate. The Trump administration might have thought the hard call was shutting down the U.S. economy. The left intends to make reopening it far harder, lacing it with political risk by raising the bar for “success” to fantasy heights. “Speaker Nancy Pelosi lashed President Donald Trump during a private call with her caucus Monday, saying he was putting Americans in grave danger if he rushes to reopen the economy at the end of this month,” reported Politico this week. The article laid out Mrs. Pelosi’s requirement: Until a robust “testing and contact tracing” system is in place, “it would be impossible for the president to guarantee Americans a safe reentry into their normal life.” Congressional Democrats are meanwhile debating their “own plan to reopen the nation,” said Politico, with legislation that would ask “each state to submit a plan” and that “would also require adequate testing and contact tracing to prevent a second outbreak.” The Washington Post reports that “Trump has been so insistent on the reopening that some officials worry only a narrow window exists to provide information to change his mind or to ensure that the effort to reopen does not significantly add to the country’s rising number of infections and deaths.” By these standards, no lockdown may end until the Trump administration can “guarantee” a “safe” world in which people return to “normal.” The feds must stand up a testing system capable of hunting down and snuffing out each new infection. There can be no more outbreaks, and reopening cannot “significantly add” to existing counts (and the press reserves the authority to define “significantly.”) The unsaid corollary is that Mr. Trump will be held politically responsible for reopening in any way that fails to meet these baselines—on the hook for each subsequent death. Talk about moving goal posts. A month ago, the administration announced its 15-day plan to “flatten the curve” and “slow the spread” of the virus. Examine those phrases. The goal of the shutdown was never to eradicate the disease—an impossibility absent a vaccine. The lockdown was designed to buy the health sector time, to make sure all the cases didn’t hit at once in a crush that would overwhelm hospitals, à la Italy. In that regard, the Trump administration has become a victim of its own success. The guidelines did flatten the curve. As ugly as the outbreak has been, even New York City and other hot spots have had enough ventilators. Numerous emergency field hospitals ended up sitting empty. The lockdown has been so effective that it has allowed Mr. Trump’s political opponents to lay out a false narrative of what counts as “victory.” The political cynicism is extraordinary. The liberal cognoscenti can read the scientific data as well as anyone; all of it makes clear this battle is far from over. While widespread testing may help, it won’t eradicate the virus. They also know even another month of lockdown, much less the year needed for a vaccine, would mean severe stress for the economy. Reopening must go forward, and that will by necessity mean more outbreaks, more cases, more deaths. That was always going to happen in a pandemic. Yet Mrs. Pelosi sees in this moment a political opportunity to pin the blame for the natural course of a disease on the White House. The administration spent this week working on a plan for reopening, holding calls with business leaders and governors, and tapping experts for a new task force. It understands it needs to get this right. Come Election Day, Mr. Trump is likely to be judged more on the success of his efforts to get the economy back on track than on the shutdown itself. That means opening in a way that doesn’t instantly lurch the country into a second “peak infection” scenario, which would inspire calls for a second debilitating shutdown. What’s missing from the White House reopening plan—and what is urgently required—is management of expectations. The administration needs to keep reminding the country of the original mission—to flatten the curve. And it needs to define quickly its own measure of success. That means explaining the limitations of even a wide-scale testing regime, preparing the country for continued rising death tolls, and warning that this virus is going to be with us for many months to come. It also means enlisting governors to help in delivering that message, as well as to share in the responsibility and rewards of reopening. No politician likes to deliver hard truths, but that’s a far better strategy for this pandemic than stepping into the trap Democrats are laying.

Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,,2020-04-18 09:07:29,"""New Data Suggest the Coronavirus Isn’t as Deadly as We Thought"" A study finds 50 to 85 times as many infections as known cases—meaning a far lower fatality rate. By Andrew Bogan, April 17, 2020  The Covid-19 shutdowns have been based on the premise that the disease would kill more than two million Americans absent drastic actions to slow its spread. That model assumed case fatality rates—the share of infected people who die from the disease—of 1% to 3%. The World Health Organization’s estimated case-fatality rate was 3.4%. Some experts—including in these pages—have questioned this assumption. They argue that known cases are likely only a small portion of the true number of infections, and thus high case-fatality rates could be off by orders of magnitude. We don’t know what portion of infections have gone undetected for a lack of tests, restrictive qualifications to get tested, and a potentially large incidence of mild illness or asymptomatic infection. New data support the skeptics’ view—a preliminary study by a Stanford team, released Friday. They conducted a seroprevalence study of Santa Clara County, Calif., on April 3 and 4. They studied a representative sample of 3,300 residents to test for the presence of antibodies in their blood that would show if they had previously been infected with the novel coronavirus. The county, where I live, is home to about two million people in the heart of Silicon Valley, including San Jose, the state’s third-largest city. It has the largest known number of cases in Northern California and saw some of the earliest cases of community spread in the U.S. The researchers found that the percentage of infections was indeed vastly larger than the roughly 1,000 known positive cases in the county at the time of the study. The preliminary results—the research will now undergo peer review—show that between 2.5% and 4.2% of county residents are estimated to have antibodies against the virus. That translates into 48,000 to 81,000 infections, 50 to 85 times as high as the number of known cases. That may sound scary, but it’s great news. It suggests that the large majority of people who contract Covid-19 recover without ever knowing they were infected, and that the U.S. infection fatality rate may be more than an order of magnitude lower than authorities had assumed. Based on this seroprevalence data, the authors estimate that in Santa Clara County the true infection fatality rate is somewhere in the range of 0.12% to 0.2%—far closer to seasonal influenza than to the original, case-based estimates. Outside California as well, preliminary data are emerging to support a more hopeful picture. In New York City, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 215 women entering two hospitals to give birth between March 22 and April 4. These patients had a Covid-19 infection rate over 15%. Of expectant mothers who tested positive for active infections, 88% were asymptomatic at the time of admission. That infection rate is about 10 times the rate of known cases in the city as a whole as of April 17—and New Yorkers have been tested for Covid-19 far more extensively than residents of other states. This study looked only at active infections, not past infections as in Santa Clara County. So in that population of pregnant women, 15% infected is a lower bound. Many others may have had a past infection only detectable on serologic tests for antibodies against the virus. Similar proportions of infections to cases are now being discovered around the world: 30 times in Robbio, Italy; 10 times in Iceland; 14 times in Gangelt, Germany; 27 times in Denmark. Germany and Denmark are now leading Europe in reopening their economies in the coming week. Sweden, concerned all along with the accuracy of early assumptions, never closed down its economy. This is not to deny that Covid-19 is more serious than influenza. Its symptoms are sometimes crueler, and it is fiercely infectious—it escaped the draconian lockdown of Wuhan and spread globally in a few months. In some places, like Northern Italy and New York, it has stretched hospital capacity and endangered or killed frontline health-care workers. Tens of thousands are dead world-wide, and there’s no vaccine. So a path forward demands continued monitoring of seroprevalence as well as new case testing, identifying and protecting those most vulnerable to more serious or even fatal infections, and supporting hospital capacity to handle surges of respiratory intensive-care patients. Yet if policy makers were aware from the outset that the Covid-19 death toll would be closer to that of seasonal flu than the millions of American deaths predicted by early models dependent on inputs that now look inaccurate, would they have risked tens of millions of jobs and livelihoods? The science to support better modeling and decision making is rapidly becoming available. One hopes that it will inform better policy decisions.

"Allen Waters for U.S. Senate,Rhode Island Republican Party",,2020-04-15 08:54:46,"The state GOP sounded alarm bells Tuesday about the potential for mail ballot fraud as a result of the suspension amid the COVID-19 crisis of laws requiring two people — or a notary — to witness the signing by voters of mail ballots cast in Rhode Island’s June 2 presidential primary. “Don’t suspend laws that safeguard our elections,″ state Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Cienki declared in a statement, accompanying the GOP’s delivery of 10-pages of legal arguments to the state Board of Elections. The GOP also questioned the necessity of sending mail ballot applications to each of Rhode Island’s 789,000-plus registered voters — as Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea intends to do — for what is likely to be a “low-turnout” contest, since the exit of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders made former Vice President Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee. The estimated cost for producing, printing and mailing the applications is $458,000, according to Gorbea’s office, with the money coming from R.I.’s $3-million share of CARES Act money allocated by Congress to assist in elections expenses related to COVID-19. “We oppose spending taxpayer money to send mail ballot applications to all Rhode Island voters when few voters will have any interest in voting in an uncontested [presidential primary],″ the GOP argued. “For the record, the RIGOP [also] opposes the suspension of laws that require: valid mail ballots to include the signature of a notary public or two witnesses ... and voters to provide proof of identity.” The GOP arguments were delivered hours ahead of a Board of Elections meeting, on Zoom, to approve a final, and more ministerial, change in dates for local canvassing boards to record mail ballot applications. The other moves were approved earlier. Cienki acknowledged that she had previously “indicated support for a predominantly mail ballot” presidential primary election. “However, neither I nor any other member of the RIGOP leadership has ever agreed to the suspension of any state laws related to mail ballots signature requirements for any election,″ she wrote. https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200414/ri-gop-warns-of-potential-mail-ballot-fraud-in-presidential-primary",62,50,1,1,2,,8,,2625592294429710,/story.php?story_fbid=2625592294429710&id=1527563887565895

Donate/Join: WatersforSenate.com ""Paycheck Protection Rejection"" Democrats block a $250 billion refill of needed business loans. Buy The Editorial Board, April 9, 2020 The Paycheck Protection Program is more popular these days than hand sanitizer. As of Wednesday, less than a week after launching, it had claims on $98 billion in forgivable business loans, out of about $350 billion available. The White House has asked for a $250 billion refill, as figures show that 6.6 million more Americans applied for jobless benefits last week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday tried to pass, by unanimous consent, a bill to this end that’s all of two pages. Its sole purpose is to raise the amount of loans available to keep small businesses afloat and workers paid through the pandemic. “We’re not talking about making any policy changes,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “We’re literally changing the number $350 [billion] to $600.” Democrats objected, and they offered their own proposal. Predictably, what they want is more of everything else. They would provide $250 billion for small businesses, but some of the funds would have set-asides, according to a memo explaining the plan, including $45 billion for “small community-based lenders,” such as “minority depository institutions, certified development corporations, microlenders.” The more complicated the rules, the slower that the cash would flow. The Democratic bill would add another $100 billion for health-care providers, though the $100 billion that Congress passed two weeks ago isn’t running dry yet. Plus there’s another $150 billion for states and localities, to backfill their tax revenues. Plus an increase in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, of $25 a month per person, on average. Oh, and work requirements would be lifted for two years. Mr. McConnell objected, naturally. His bill—all 25 lines of it—was narrow and should have been uncontroversial. Instead Congress is back to stalemate. As Democrats look at this unprecedented economic crisis, they are unfortunately still channeling Rahm Emanuel’s old line that it would be a terrible thing to waste.

Beth Max, I am a 64 year old, male heterosexual with no gender identity issues, and I am not a socialist.  A 4th generation resident of Providence. I attended Classical HS ('73) and URI (B.S. Business Administration). I am a career financial consultant (FINRA Brokercheck), and father of five, three are still dependents.  I have owned a fee based money management firm and a commercial cleaning business. If you want to catch a politician doing something, you might catch me driving Uber, a side hustle for five years. Like many middle class Rhode Islanders, I have sometimes worked my primary job and one or two part time jobs six or seven days a week. My campaign is my full time job. I have served on a number of non profit boards, including the Providence Country Day School, Rhode Island Black Heritage Society, and South Providence Tutorial. Although, I lived in Mashpee on Cape Cod for fifteen years, and Baltimore for two, I raised a family in East Providence, and currently live in the home I was raised in. My family moved to the West End of Providence in 1960. My father was a Providence Patrolman on motorcycle 1954-1973, and a cabinet maker and contractor in his own business after that. My mom retired from Wheeler School after 25 years as a lead bookkeeper.
