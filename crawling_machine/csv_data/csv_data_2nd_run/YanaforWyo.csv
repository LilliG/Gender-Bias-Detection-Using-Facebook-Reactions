Folks are putting themselves at risk to bring you your food. Please treat them like human beings who deserve both respect AND to be able to feed themselves.Last night as we were waiting curbside at Born in A Barn, we witnessed the waiter deliver food, CURBSIDE to a large SUV.  As he was walking away, he was shaking his head and chuckling.  We rolled our window down and offered him encouragement and that although he looked exhausted, he was doing a great job running food curbside.  He shared with us that he just delivered $80 worth of food CURBSIDE to that SUV and they didn‚Äôt tip him.  He stated that he was still working off of server wages and people just aren‚Äôt tipping right now.  When I paid (earlier) I gave a 30% tip and to know that others who are blessed and have the funds to eat ‚Äúout‚Äù during this time are not (especially on an $80 ticket) was heartbreaking.  We covered the tip for that $80 ticket and hope and pray that whomever was in that SUV pays in forward, some how, some way, in the future.  Please remember our servers during this time!

Her comment makes a lot more sense with the right number! Here's a quote from the Common Dreams articel she got hat number from: ""More than $4 trillion of that estimate is predicated on using $454 billion of CARES Act money to back Federal Reserve-based corporate loans. The Fed has the magical power to leverage, or multiply, money it receives from the Treasury up to 10 times over. In the end, according to the president, that could mean $4.5 trillion in support for big banks and corporate entities versus something like $1.4 trillion for regular Americans, small businesses, hospitals, and local and state governments. That 3.5 to 1 ratio signals that, as in 2008, the Treasury and the Fed are focused on big banks and large corporations, not everyday Americans.""",15,10,,1,1,,3,,559813351577328,/story.php?story_fbid=559813351577328&id=337963610428971

"Yana for Wyo,Charles Pelkey",,2020-04-22 18:59:27,"I will be very interested in the Governor's message tomorrow. And glad to hear the general tone will be leaning toward science and public health and not caving in to pressure to jump the gun.We - other legislators and I - just completed the latest in a series of conference calls with Governor Gordon. He says he wants to err on the side of caution and rely on health experts to say when this state can ease restrictions on businesses and individuals around the state of Wyoming. Our conversation was fairly short on detail, but the governor will be holding a press conference tomorrow at 3:00 p.m., which will be streamed on WyomingPBS.org. I urge all of you to tune in and then follow-up with your concerns to ""governor@wyo.gov"". Governor Gordon is working to balance competing interests and he agrees that the health of our citizens should remain on the top of all of our lists. Tune in tomorrow to see what his plans are for our state. Keep in mind that the governor is suddenly under a lot of pressure to ""reopen"" the economy no matter what the recommendations from health officials might be. He appears to be inclined to follow the science and not the politics. I respect that. Thankfully, it was the governor who pointed out that the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic had a brief decline in fatalities, which led first to a loosening of restrictions and then an even greater spike in the number of dead that followed.  Please, let's not allow history to repeat itself. Let's watch out for the health and safety of ALL of Wyoming's citizens.

"Yana for Wyo,Taj James",,2020-04-06 09:47:01,"Interesting.  The possible reading of this is that not feeling fear is somehow more enlightened or the right answer. As someone whose pre-Carona life is constructed mainly for those two outer rungs (re climate and ending oppressions of all kinds) I assure you that fear (and anger) are regular guests at my table.  In fact, welcoming them makes growth and action possible and far more sustainable. If we aren't connected to our real emotions, it is very, very hard to have real compassion for other people's suffering. But we can't let fear run us.  The world needs us in growth and action modes right now. This is always what this campaign has been about. Compassionate, effective solidarity building for a world that genuinely works for all of us.Grace. No shame.

Yana for Wyo,,2020-03-31 22:16:38,"I have a request. Please watch the film: Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution. Give the disability rights movement two hours of your isolation time and attention. It's an amazing story and it is told compellingly. I cried. Three times. The first is when the Black Panthers show up to feed the disability right's activists who have occupied a building in San Francisco. The level of solidarity between civil rights movements is incredibly moving. The queer community showed up, too. And of course there is so much diversity within the disability community... as much as anywhere else. And that model of deep solidarity is what we need right now.  The second time I cried was when that truth landed in my body. We need each other. We are in crisis right now, and we very much need the level of care and coming together that this film documents so beautifully. ""No one is free while anyone is oppressed."" It's always been true. Please watch and join me in the recognition that this fight is not over. The Americans With Disabilities Act has never been fully enacted, and it is time to stop asking people to wait for their legal rights to be fully recognized and enacted.  And there is so much more to do. The Rose Caucus (of which I am a founding member) has an evolving platform. Our current Disabilities Rights platform, developed in partnership with the disability community as well as with our own disabled caucus members, is summarized here: DISABILITY RIGHTS  1. TIME Act  2. Expand SSDI  3. Eliminate SSI waiting period.  4. Eliminate requirement to ‚Äòprove‚Äô disability. 5. Education & Jobs  6. Ratify CRPD  7. Marriage Equality  8. Pay Equity 9. Update ADA  10. IDEA  11. Pass the Disabilities Integration Act of 2019  12. ADRCs  13. Public Accessibility  14. FDESA  15. Housing Stability  16. MFP  17. Universal ADA Compliance  18. Pay Family Caregivers and Expand Caregiver Hours 19. Community Care 20. FCCA  21. Federalize Workers Compensation.  22. Right to Long-Term Care  23. Personal Property Protections  24. Eliminate EVV  25. Opioid Access  26. Immigrants‚Äô Protections  27. Improve research and funding for rare diseases.  28. FJG Inclusion  29. Cannabis as Medicine  You can read more in our platform document, below (especially because many of us are just starting the journey of learning not only the acronyms but the issues and deep human impacts of what this all really means).

There's a lot to cover, and we want to hear from you as this thing unfolds in our communities around the state.  Next week we will be taking up various human rights issues that were suggested from folks on this page, and then next Sunday will be a special event in our Town Hall slot, a youth activist consensus training.

Yana for Wyo,,2020-03-16 18:02:18,"Proud to be a member of the Rose Caucus today as we have put together petitions to all state Governors asking for immediate tangible support for working people. Please join me in signing!  To Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) has been classified as a global pandemic. Wyoming already has at least 3 confirmed cases statewide. State and federal officials are encouraging people who feel sick to stay home, but many workers already struggle to make rent or mortgage payments. The choice to skip work for the sake of community health could leave them and their families unsheltered. In order to protect the health and housing security of our community, we, the undersigned, call on Governor Gordon to act now so workers won't have to make that choice. Specifically, we call for a suspension of all rent, mortgage, and utility payments for 2 full months to allow people to do what they need to in order to take care of themselves, their loved ones, and the community.  The legacy of every public official currently serving will be determined in the next few months. It's time to act now, and choose the right side of history. Choose the people. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfizGw9COSv3DlUwaRdkWha4s14JO-9oV9FVWeZ4qj4LOsYKw/viewform",24,12,,12,,,,,532225921002738,/story.php?story_fbid=532225921002738&id=337963610428971

Corona virus has not yet hit Wyoming in full force, and each of us taking responsibility for minimizing collective risk is the best thing we can do to slow its spread, and make sure our hospital infrastructure does not get overwhelmed with too many cases too quickly. My whole campaign is about policies that save lives, and lead to a higher quality of life for everyone. In alignment with that, we are making this decision to move campaigning to online forums and phone calls for the time being. In no way are we suspending our fight for Medicare for All, paid sick leave, and raises in minimum wage, all of which would have positioned us far differently than where we are now for dealing with this crisis.  I'm appalled at the failure of the federal government to deal with this crisis in a coherent, responsible and compassionate way, and particularly at Donald Trump's choice to pour over a trillion dollars into a Wall Street bailout rather than public health responses.

Yana for Wyo,,2020-02-28 22:22:27,"I may have lost a vote today of someone I really respect. On the long drive home, I thought about it a fair bit. Essentially me short-handing where I stand on a bunch of stuff by saying I am ""the Bernie Sanders in the race"" is hard for some people who are still hurting from the hard stuff that went down around the 2016 race between Sanders and Clinton. I want to say that I get it. 2016 was messy from a LOT of angles, and trust has not been fully restored between the different groups. And people are nervous about a repeat and it is leaving a lot of folks on edge. (This despite a pretty major leadership and systems reboot within the Wyoming party.) I also want to say this: I'm owning that I believe in  Bernie Sanders, both as a man of integrity and also that I think his policy approaches are the most compassionate, inclusive and responsible of all of the candidates, and that my own policy stances are the most closely aligned with his of all the presidential candidates. When I say I'm a Sanders Dem, it is shorthand for many things. I also want that statement to be helpful. We are going to have a real primary, and I believe in democracy. That means that I want you to vote for the person in the primary that you sincerely believe-- based on being informed-- is holding both the vision and the policy that will best support you, your family and the communities you care about to get the world you need to survive, and that fires your imagination for a really GOOD future. So I'm going to be honest. You are going to know what I believe, even if we all know some of that is a stretch for many people. You are going to know who and what I stand for. And if we disagree, I'm going to stay in the conversation with you long enough for us to understand our differences and where they are coming from.  This isn't political gamesmanship on my part. It is an attempt to be that thing that we all want and are mostly deeply skeptical about: an honest candidate. And it is an attempt to support actual informed democracy. I tell ya what: let's make a deal. I will be as fully honest as I can be, and encourage the other candidates in the race to be as well. In return, will you please NOT check your discernment at the door? Will you please look at the candidates in terms of policy and vote accordingly?  I think if we each do that, we are doing our best by the values of democracy.",61,45,,16,,,,,521088288783168,/story.php?story_fbid=521088288783168&id=337963610428971

"Yana for Wyo,Sweetwater County Sheriff's Office",,2020-02-19 16:07:42,"‚ÄúICE remains committed to removing dangerous, recidivist criminals from our communities and restoring integrity to our nation‚Äôs immigration system,‚Äù said ICE Public Affairs Officer Alethea Smock. I wasn't aware that our immigration system was on even passing terms with ""integrity"". Note that several of the people this press releasing is referencing had warrants for pretty minor offenses. Their main ""crime"" seems to be being brown people, and the punishment is completely out of proportion.Sheriff's Office addresses recent ""ICE holds"" at Detention Center On Fri., Feb. 14, 2020, Sweetwater County Detention Center temporarily housed 11 out-of-state inmates who were pending transfer into federal custody by U.S. immigration authorities. Given some of the corresponding publicity surrounding local media coverage of these particular jail bookings, we find it prudent in our statutory duty as custodian of the county jail to take this opportunity to clarify and educate the community about this aspect of jail operations. The Detention Center is authorized by existing inter-governmental contracts and memoranda of understanding to house inmates on behalf of a variety of local, state and federal law enforcement and public safety organizations including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wyoming Department of Family Services, Wyoming Department of Corrections and a growing regional network of neighboring Wyoming counties and municipalities. Built in 2005, the Detention Center is a state-of-the-art county correctional facility featuring a maximum prisoner capacity of over 200 inmates.  It is currently one of only four facilities across the state with a separate juvenile holding unit, which is legally required to house juvenile inmates.  The Detention Center represents a large and complex operation, which is staffed by over 50 Sheriff‚Äôs Office employees including approximately 20 state-certified detention officers, 10 control room operators (for around-the-clock coverage) and numerous support staff (such as various administrative, transport and medical personnel). While the housing of local prisoners always takes precedence, when vacancy permits, temporarily accommodating inmates-in-transit from these outside organizations helps offset the costs of jail operations by offering an added source of revenue for the County‚Äôs general fund.  Depending on the contract or MOU, the County is compensated $60 to $80 per inmate per day for a total of $350,000 to $500,000 annually.   With respect to ‚ÄúICE holds‚Äù specifically, according to their annual operations report for Fiscal Year 2019, ICE removed or returned a total of 267,000 illegal immigrants.  Their Enforcement and Removal Operations arrested 143,000 individuals, more than 86% of whom had criminal convictions, pending criminal charges or previously issued final orders. ‚ÄúICE remains committed to removing dangerous, recidivist criminals from our communities and restoring integrity to our nation‚Äôs immigration system,‚Äù said ICE Public Affairs Officer Alethea Smock. According to the Sheriff‚Äôs Office public relations officer, Deputy Jason Mower, ‚ÄúIn each case at our Detention Center, these inmates are either previously convicted or currently facing criminal charges and awaiting transfer into federal custody by ICE for additional alleged immigration violations.‚Äù Mower continued, ‚ÄúWhile we do work in conjunction with ICE to identify those arrested for criminal activity who may also be subject to deportation or other immigration proceedings, we do not possess the lawful authority to enforce federal immigration law nor to detain anyone indefinitely absent pending or formal criminal charges.‚Äù",8,4,,,,2,2,,515686129323384,/story.php?story_fbid=515686129323384&id=337963610428971

""No one wants to move to Wyoming."" And ya know, I get it. I get that this has been the norm in Wyoming for a while, and that people are feeling discouraged... some even hopeless. I've lived in economically depressed places before, places where losing population was accepted as just the way it is, so all of this is familiar to me. I was, in fact, once one of those young people who couldn't get the hell out of my small town fast enough. But here's what I don't get: stopping the conversation there. Wyoming is a remarkable place. It is a beautiful state filled with some incredible badasses. We have an abundance of resources, both under the ground and in the sky. We have a deep sense of pride in community, and when push comes to shove, I see y'all having each others backs.  So let's try something different. Let's envision the Wyoming that could be. What if we did what we need to do to reinvigorate the economy, this time in ways that are sustainable, both ecologically and economically? What if we deliberately built stronger community? What if we began to take as much pride in our diversity as we do in our badassery? What if a healthy dose of interdependence joined our independent streak, and we got the benefits of both?

"Yana for Wyo,Matt J Stannard",,2020-02-08 13:40:57,"Both the original article and Matt's analysis are interesting.  Another point, from several friends who work the call centers doing surveys, including political polling: young people are far less likely to pick up their phones. This means they tend to be under-represented in polling, even when the pollsters are dialing their numbers. And young people are far more likely to like Sanders.  I suspect his numbers, which already indicate he is the leader in most states for the primary, and also that he is the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump, are probably low estimates if anything.Disagree with Matthew Yglesias's assertion that ""far left"" politics isn't a ""winning hand."" IF the DNC and party establishment even conditionally embraced social democracy--embraced it pragmatically as the current zeitgeist necessary to win this election-- it would create a huge tent ranging from moderates who like unions to independents and of course DSA- and Bernie-supporting dems. I've also seen MANY third party and hard left socialists embrace Bernie this time around--probably a third to half of the lefties Clinton lost will come back for Bernie. That's a million more votes, including in places like Wisconsin and Michigan where the Greens' numbers were significant in '16. BERNIE WILL BRING THOSE PEOPLE OVER. Don't mock or underestimate that and then be salty about them not coming back for a centrist.  As I've observed many times, lots of conservatives love Bernie: certainly more than loved Clinton. They like his consistency, which sure, that feels weird to liberals and academics who point out the incongruity of their respect for consistency of values they disagree with...but what if there's a kind of universality  to Bernie's vision of sharing and community that speaks across partisan lines? And remember, many of those Republicans were working class Democrats until Reagan lied to them so effectively. I only need to be partially right about all of this.  But I do agree with the central thesis of the piece: Bernie is smart, his campaign and strategists are smart...and his policy advisers will be a combination of smart and idealistic in a way that should please those nostalgic for the best of Obama's team--not the Rahms and Axelrods but the young idealists who populated the rank and file jobs. Expect those but even better. And I hope the campaign continues to make good decisions in the meantime.  The cusp between democratic socialism and social democracy is both smart policy and smart politics. People are longing for real hope. Bernie asks: are you willing to stand up for people you don't know, people who are different than you? A partly-silent majority (fronted by a vocal and sometimes overly-enthisiastic and anarchical vanguard) longs for the answer to this to be yes.",11,10,,1,,,,,507874076771256,/story.php?story_fbid=507874076771256&id=337963610428971

I have been friends with a couple dozen women and one man who were former or current sex workers at the time we were close. All of them did that work because, like everyone else around us, they chose the best economic option for themselves. Two of them liked the work and the rest didn't. (Those percentages track similarly to minimum wage fast food workers I've been close to, BTW.) Several had kids they were supporting and literally could not find any other work that allowed them to pay the bills. Two were savvy young entrepreneurial types who were working on getting small businesses off the ground and this was the best way for them to make money to pour into that business.  Sex work is work.

First of all, every Democrat in Wyoming will have the ability to participate - every registered Dem will receive a ballot in the mail. Once received and completed, it can be mailed back (in a postage-paid envelope that's included), taken to a drop-off location in your county on March 28, or dropped off at the county convention/caucus on April 4. Next, all votes are being cast on a ranked-choice ballot - no more headcounts. We'll have an accurate number. And because it's a ranked-choice ballot, all of the ""realignment"" you see happening in Iowa right now will occur almost instantly in Wyoming - there will be very little waiting for final results.

The gist is that US involvement with Iran began when Iran decided to socialize their oil fields rather than have them owned by foreign companies. Let that sink in. We decided to mess with a country that was taking care of their people with their own resources, rather than letting wealthy American and British interests use them. That was the start of this whole mythology around American interests being threatened. It wasn't about American lives. It was about American corporate interests. That's our legacy there.  And you can trace all of the hostilities toward us (which are real) back to this, and to acts like this. So when do we stop the cycle? When do we stop spending over half of our budget on the military, on these kinds of 1% manufactured ""interests""?

"Yana for Wyo,Yana Ludwig",,2019-12-31 13:16:28,"For folks interested in my personal reflections on the journey that has been my last decade, here ya go. Wishing everyone a very happy new year! 2020 is going to be an amazing year of growth and change, and I'm happy to be in this with all of you.I'm looking back on a decade ago, as we are wont to do when these things come to a close.  10 years ago, I was in my very first week of doctors' appointments for what would turn into a 10 month mystery search to understand why I was incredibly sick and getting sicker. It seems like longer than a decade, honestly. Maybe because I lost the bulk of the first three years of it to chronic Lyme disease. But I got better. I'm very, very lucky on that front. Many of the people who I met during those years are still home-bound, bed bound. Some have died, and a few are lucky like me and are back on our feet and doing our lives. Lyme taught me that my worth and my ability to make money are not the same thing. It taught me that I could survive and even find the strength to be an agent of my own survival when things were incredibly hard to even get out of bed. It also taught me that my time here is precious and limited, and I sure as hell better be doing something good with it. So the rest of the decade has been better, though really hard at many moments: I've stretched myself in ways I could never have imagined and have gone places (literally and figuratively) I never thought I'd go. But I've done my best to heed the ""do something good with your time"" lesson.  In 2013, I did a TEDx talk called ""Sustainable is Possible! (And it doesn't suck...)"" and became the first Executive Director of the Center for Sustainable and Cooperative Culture. In 2014, I was part of a fledging anti-racism group in rural Missouri, while leading the development of that nonprofit from an incredibly barebones operation to a thriving organization. Also, it was my year of the empty nest as my son started college. In 2015, I spent half of the year on the road doing a national speaking tour about community building and climate disruption, got divorced from my second husband, and met Matt J Stannard. In 2016, I moved to Wyoming, left Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage where I had lived for over 8 years and built my own strawbale home, become the Executive Director of Commonomics USA, and went to my first New Economy Coalition gathering. In 2017, I published ""Together Resilient: Building Community in the Age of Climate Disruption"" which later that year won the Communal Studies Association Book of the Year Award. Somewhere in there, I did a research study on success factors in cooperative living with Zach Rubin and Don Willis, which later resulted in my first publication in an academic journal. Perhaps most importantly, I married Matt and officially because the step-mom to some amazing kids. In 2018, after three years of organizing work, the Solidarity Collective found its home outside of Laramie on 3 acres of land and in one of the oldest still-standing buildings in Wyoming, becoming Wyoming's only commune. I was also a founding member of Albany County for Proper Policing, and worked as a professional organizer for the first time for Showing Up for Racial Justice. In 2019, I became a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, and launched my US Senate campaign.

Always this decade, I've been either a Board or staff member of the Foundation for Intentional Community. I've facilitated hundreds of meetings, and participated in even more.

Yana for Wyo,,2019-12-29 18:15:58,"Running into folks saying odd things about Yana and our campaign? This list is for you! Here's the top ten misperceptions she ran into in her first 6 months of the campaign, and some reality checks you can share with others. (You can get a downloadable version of this list on our website at: https://www.yana4wyo.com/listening) 1) Yana doesn‚Äôt want to take away your freedom to choose your doctor. In fact, she wants to expand it for the vast majority of us. Medicare For All would give you maximum choice of who you can see, unlike private insurers that put all kinds of restrictions on our medical choices. 2) Yana is pro-workers. All workers. This includes military personnel, coal miners, auto workers, and literally anyone else who needs to work for a living. Whatever criticisms she may have of the companies people work for, she recognizes that we are in a shared struggle for economic security. 3) Yana isn‚Äôt running on gun control. While there are a few things Yana would support (like domestic abusers losing their right to own guns) this is not a major focus for her. She‚Äôs only really interested in gun control within the context of a much bigger conversation that includes police reform. 4) Socialism means worker ownership and a significantly democratized economy. It does not mean the government owning everything or everyone working for the government. Yana would find both of those ideas pretty offensive, too. Good thing that‚Äôs not what she‚Äôs advocating! 5) Yana is definitely not a millionaire. Yana‚Äôs net worth is negative, and she‚Äôs never made more than $32K in a year. She‚Äôs part of the economically insecure 60% of Americans. 6) Yana does not ‚Äúhate America‚Äù. In fact, she loves this place. What she hates is the 1% controlling everything, and working people getting screwed over regularly. She also knows we still need to reconcile with the US legacy of slavery and Indigenous people‚Äôs genocide, and she will work to dismantle the racist systems that still exist in this country.  7) The Green New Deal that Yana advocates for is as much an economic development plan as an ecological preservation one. It is also particularly focused on care for traditional fossil fuel states like West Virginia and Wyoming.  8) Yana is not against hunting, fishing or recreation. She grew up doing all three. In fact, the advocacy of public lands access is a core part of her campaign and she thinks we can do a lot better than our current representatives in DC are doing on this issue.  9) Yana doesn‚Äôt want to kill small businesses and small farms. In fact, she thinks they are the cornerstone of any healthy local economy. She also favors a ‚Äúright of first refusal‚Äù law for employees to be able to buy their businesses, rather than having situations like mines being sold by one wealthy, out-of-state owner to the next, without any regard for local communities. 10) Yana doesn‚Äôt think everyone should live in ecovillages or communes. Yes, she lives in one, which is how she knows from first hand experience that it isn‚Äôt for everyone. She does want it to be easier to form such communities for those who want it, but that‚Äôs in the name of expanded freedoms, not forced lifestyle choices.",36,30,,6,,,,,477539923138005,/story.php?story_fbid=477539923138005&id=337963610428971

We need to take it seriously, or we will continue to be a nation divided, and a nation with deep compromises to our American values of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness for many of our people.President George W. Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, has a message for people who are excusing President Trump's racism: ""I had fully intended to ignore President Trump‚Äôs latest round of racially charged taunts against an African American elected official, and an African American activist, and an African American journalist and a whole city with a lot of African Americans in it. I had every intention of walking past Trump‚Äôs latest outrages and writing about the self-destructive squabbling of the Democratic presidential field, which has chosen to shame former vice president Joe Biden for the sin of being an electable, moderate liberal. But I made the mistake of pulling James Cone‚Äôs 'The Cross and the Lynching Tree' off my shelf ‚Äî a book designed to shatter convenient complacency. Cone recounts the case of a white mob in Valdosta, Ga., in 1918 that lynched an innocent man named Haynes Turner. Turner‚Äôs enraged wife, Mary, promised justice for the killers. The sheriff responded by arresting her and then turning her over to the mob, which included women and children. According to one source, Mary was 'stripped, hung upside down by the ankles, soaked with gasoline, and roasted to death. In the midst of this torment, a white man opened her swollen belly with a hunting knife and her infant fell to the ground and was stomped to death.' God help us. It is hard to write the words. This evil ‚Äî the evil of white supremacy, resulting in dehumanization, inhumanity and murder ‚Äî is the worst stain, the greatest crime, of U.S. history. It is the thing that nearly broke the nation. It is the thing that proved generations of Christians to be vicious hypocrites. It is the thing that turned normal people into moral monsters, capable of burning a grieving widow to death and killing her child. When the president of the United States plays with that fire or takes that beast out for a walk, it is not just another political event, not just a normal day in campaign 2020. It is a cause for shame. It is the violation of martyrs‚Äô graves. It is obscene graffiti on the Lincoln Memorial.

I don't know how any conversation about gun violence can be a true conversation without considering the level of violence Americans use to solve problems in general, whether that is in foreign policy, interpersonal relationships or police violence.  Violence-as-the-answer is a culture-wide problem, and brown and black people are almost always much more on the receiving end of that violence than white people are. With young Black men it is especially bad: ""...police use of force accounted for 1.6% of all deaths of black men between the ages of 20 and 24.""  1.6% of ALL deaths of young Black men.
