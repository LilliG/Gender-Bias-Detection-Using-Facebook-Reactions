"Rik Mehta for Senate,Gloucester County GOP",,2020-02-25 13:17:03,"I'm proud to earn the endorsement of Gloucester County Republicans and thank Chairwoman Jacci Vigilante for her strong leadership. Keep your eyes on Gloucester County, folks, it is one of the emerging GOP counties in our state!  It's an honor to share the line under President Trump and with Congressman Van Drew. Together, we will make #jerseyproud in Washington!South Jersey is Trump Country Fellow Republicans: If you haven’t noticed – SOUTH JERSEY IS TRUMP COUNTRY! It truly is an exciting time to be a Republican in South Jersey. Just this past Friday evening, the Gloucester County GOP held our Third Annual Lincoln Reagan Dinner. Our featured speaker was the Honorable Kellyanne Conway, Special Counselor to President Donald Trump. The White House, under any administration, doesn’t send high level presidential advisors to events in places that don’t matter. If Ms. Conway’s presence at our Lincoln Reagan Dinner doesn’t convince you that South Jersey is Trump Country consider this:  October 2019: Eric and Lara Trump appear at a Camden County GOP fundraiser. December 2019: Congressman Jeff Van Drew switches parties and is now our incumbent Republican Congressman. January 2020: President Donald Trump holds a rally in Wildwood. Last week: John Pence, Senior Advisor to President Trump’s re-election campaign visits Egg Harbor Township to take part in Trump Victory Leadership Initiative Training. This past Friday: Kellyanne Conway was the keynote speaker at the Gloucester County GOP fundraiser. A Congressman flipped, a Presidential rally, a visit by the President’s son and daughter-in-law, a visit by the Vice President’s nephew and a visit by the Special Counselor to the President all within four months shows how important South Jersey is to Donald Trump. As an organization, it is our job to keep the momentum going, and we will!!! The Gloucester County GOP has announced our Freeholder Candidates. Greenwich Township Mayor George Shivery has decided not to run for a seventh consecutive term as Mayor and instead is running for Freeholder, George’s record speaks for itself. Woodbury Heights business owner Chris Konawel brings his years of business experience to the team, make no mistake, he’s a fighter, in the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation to be exact. Rounding out the team is Franklin Township School Board member since 2015 Nick DeSilvio. Since joining the Board they have stayed below the 2% tax cap and just last year Nick found taxpayers a savings of $200,000. We have a solid team running for Freeholder.  The top of the ticket is exciting – President Donald Trump – you know his record, a booming economy, a stronger military and he’s building the wall, making our nation safer. In the US Senate race, after a thorough screening process, the Screening Committee recommended to the Executive Board Rik Mehta gets the Party line. The Executive Board agrees, Rik Mehta is the Gloucester County GOP’s endorsed candidate for US Senate. Also, earning the party’s endorsement for the Second Congressional District (CD2) is incumbent Congressman Jeff Van Drew. Gloucester County GOP is proud to join President Trump in endorsing Congressman Van Drew. In the First Congressional District (CD1) Claire Gustafson has earned the party’s endorsement. For those who don’t know Claire has repeatedly stepped up for the Camden County GOP, is a former member of the School Board in Collingswood, is the Collingswood Republican chair and most recently resurrected Camden County’s Republican women organization. Both, Congressman Van Drew and Claire Gustafson care about our county and respect our process, so much so that while no other candidates for Congress in either district asked to be screened they both appeared before the Screening Committee because they wanted to earn our endorsement and not simply be given the line. As your County GOP Chairwoman, I am excited that South Jersey is Trump Country. I’m proud of the work our Screening Committee did vetting candidates for federal office. And, there is no doubt we have assembled a fantastic team of Freeholder candidates. I look forward too much electoral success in 2020!

Days prior, they attacked our American Embassy. This clear act of aggression by Iran can not be tolerated. As a nation, we must strive for peace. For warmongering countries like Iran, we must stand with our military, and use all available resources to protect our national interests, our allies, and our Americans abroad. No one wants war, but Americans will not compromise freedom. I am also shocked by the actions of Cory Booker, the Senator is crying “abuse of power” all over the media because of the president's use of one drone strike. Where was Cory Booker during the 571 drone strikes that President Obama ordered? The hypocrisy coming from Senator Booker's failing presidential campaign is shameful.” -Rik",107,97,,9,1,,,,157838205627271,/story.php?story_fbid=157838205627271&id=108247910586301

Reason #1: Rain Tax Comment from NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt: “A rainy day fund used to be what responsible government collected for emergencies. Not anymore. Not in New Jersey. And not under Governor Murphy. Today, it’s just another Democratic property tax and Trenton money grab. Instead of feeding your families, Phil Murphy’s rain tax scheme drains money from your pockets and pours it into Trenton’s coffers, to feed Murphy’s liberal agenda. None of that should come as a surprise, since the Governor let slip that, “If tax rate is your issue … we’re probably not your state.”",49,46,,3,,,,,131517374926021,/story.php?story_fbid=131517374926021&id=108247910586301

Reason #1: Rain Tax Comment from NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt: “A rainy day fund used to be what responsible government collected for emergencies. Not anymore. Not in New Jersey. And not under Governor Murphy. Today, it’s just another Democratic property tax and Trenton money grab. Instead of feeding your families, Phil Murphy’s rain tax scheme drains money from your pockets and pours it into Trenton’s coffers, to feed Murphy’s liberal agenda. None of that should come as a surprise, since the Governor let slip that, “If tax rate is your issue … we’re probably not your state.”",49,46,,3,,,,,131517374926021,/story.php?story_fbid=131517374926021&id=108247910586301

He's certainly not in New Jersey, helping the people who put him in office.  He might be in Iowa - or maybe New Hampshire - holding events with voters he doesn't represent while running in a race that he'll never win. I don't know where he is, but I do know he isn't doing his job.
