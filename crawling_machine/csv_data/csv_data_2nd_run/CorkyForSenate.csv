,,2020-04-26 18:04:53,"Time Matters in a Crisis. Tomorrow, small business #PPPloans will begin again. This is almost 3 weeks after Republicans proposed a 2-page amendment to the CARES Act to increase PPP loans from $350B to $600B. During that almost 3 week delay, tens of thousands of Granite Staters lost their jobs. Thousands of small New Hampshire businesses closed forever. How many of New Hampshire‚Äôs 16,000 veteran-owned businesses closed? Dreams evaporated. Jobs lost. For a small business, every day counts and every day in a crisis counts exponentially. Jeanne Shaheen should be held accountable for this carnage. Instead of fighting for Granite State businesses and employees, her loyalty was with Pelosi, Schumer and AOC. Instead of bragging about being a lead negotiator, Shaheen should have used that leadership position to fight for New Hampshire businesses and employees and insisted that the PPP funding be approved urgently to save those businesses. Yet, she dabbled in politics and many businesses and jobs were destroyed by this delay. Time matters in a crisis. I‚Äôm for hospitals receiving as much money as they need as a result of the #COVID19 virus.  Don‚Äôt be fooled by D.C. Jeanne Shaheen. She will brag that the delay resulted in an additional $75 billion for hospitals.  FACT: Hospitals were allocated $100B in the CARES Act.  FACT: $70B of that amount is still available for hospitals. Adding in the additional $75B, there is now available $145B for hospitals. Why delay PPP loans to leverage for more money for hospitals when there was already money available from the original CARES Act for hospitals? Well, it sounds good politically. D.C. Jeanne Shaheen‚Äôs political calculus is simple ‚Äì let Granite State businesses close so she can have a political victory by pulling in more money for hospitals. You see, it doesn‚Äôt matter that the hospitals have plenty of money available. It‚Äôs good politics to say she got more money for hospitals. Time matters in a crisis. Don‚Äôt let politics matter in a crisis. -Corky",21,18,,3,,,,,241541583867593,/story.php?story_fbid=241541583867593&id=105368190818267
