R-CALF United Stockgrowers of America   For Immediate Release   April 29, 2020  R-CALF USA CEO Bill Bullard Phone: 406-252-2516; r-calfusa@r-calfusa.com View and share this news release on Facebook here. Ranch Group's Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling Petition Gains 250K Signatures in 7 Days  Billings, Mont. - Launched Thursday morning by R-CALF USA and several of its rancher-members, the petition urging the President and Congress to immediately pass Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling (MCOOL) for beef, pork and dairy products has gained 250K signatures in just 7 days. R-CALF USA states in the petition that MCOOL will strengthen national food security and help stimulate economic growth. The petition can be viewed at www.DemandUSABeef.com. R-CALF USA member Kerry Cramton, a Kansas cattle producer who, among several other grassroots cattle producers, was instrumental in launching the petition and said the goal is to demonstrate to the President and Congress that they have been deceived into believing that neither consumers nor cattle producers wanted a mandatory law to provide consumers information as to where their beef, pork and dairy products actually originate. ""There is a handful of very powerful lobbying groups that have held the President and Congress at bay on this critically important initiative and our petition clearly shows that our government has been misled,"" said Cramton. ""Consumers want to know where their beef is produced and they deserve the opportunity to support American ranchers by purchasing beef exclusively born, raised, and harvested in the United States,"" she added. R-CALF USA has strongly supported MCOOL ever since it helped pass the original law in 2002. The meatpacking lobby fought aggressively to repeal MCOOL for beef and pork ever since - failing to do so in a U.S. federal court in 2013, but ultimately succeeding in 2015 with the help of an adverse ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO). As the COVID-19 pandemic backs up United States cattle due to processing plant slow-downs and shut-downs, leaving many American ranchers with no access to the marketplace, meatpackers are continually sourcing cheaper foreign cattle to the detriment of U.S. cattle producers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that during the last two weeks U.S. meatpackers sourced over 12,000 live cattle from Canada to be harvested in the United States. ""This is unconscionable,"" said R-CALF USA CEO Bill Bullard who said his group has members who have not been able to get a bid for their cattle for the past five weeks."" Bullard said if MCOOL were in place today, consumers could immediately correct this situation by choosing to buy beef that is exclusively born, raised, and harvested in the United States, which he said would help American ranchers. Bullard said MCOOL would also help consumers avoid beef produced in foreign countries with ongoing animal disease problems and unknown animal husbandry practices. In February the USDA announced it would begin allowing imports of raw beef from Brazil. The USDA then welcomed the first shipment of raw beef into the U.S. from Namibia, Africa on April 17. Both countries are known to harbor foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the most contagious disease known to cattle, hogs, sheep, deer and other cloven-hoofed animals. In addition, in recent years the Brazilian food inspection system was cited for corrupt practices. Bullard said there was a 22% surge in the combined volume of beef and cattle imports from mid-March to early April.  ""While American ranchers are unable to access their own market, importers and meatpackers are increasing the volume of imported beef while simultaneously depriving U.S. cattle farmers and ranchers' access to their own markets. This has to stop and MCOOL will put the choice in consumers' hands as to where they want their beef to be born, raised and harvested,"" said Bullard adding, ""We are confident that most consumers will want USA beef."" Given the hugely successful petition drive for MCOOL, R-CALF USA has now established a 'Demand USA Beef' Fundly crowdfunding page in an effort to raise $50,000 so it can bolster the group's promotional and lobbying efforts to secure the passage of MCOOL for beef, pork and dairy products as quickly as possible. Last month, R-CALF USA launched a new Website www.USABeef.org, a free platform for cattle ranchers and farmers who raise and sell cattle or beef that is exclusively USA born, raised, and harvested directly to consumers. The site is growing daily and currently includes 335 farms, ranches and businesses from 41 states. Consumers can call the beef providers on this list to obtain USA beef produced in their state. # # # R-CALF USA (Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America) is the largest producer-only lobbying and trade association representing U.S. cattle producers.

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-04-30 12:24:53,"Tuesday night, President Donald Trump, under the National Defense Production Act, signed an executive order to reopen U.S. meat mega-packing plants, for the purpose of relieving farmers from killing their animals because processing is shut down, and to continue the meat supply. One farm leader, who spoke at the Schiller Institute April 25-26 conference, immediately stressed today: “OK, but only keep the cartel meat packing houses open until you can phase them out forever. It never should have been this way in the first place.” U.S. and international agriculture have been being destructured during recent decades, so that a few Wall Street/City London cartels dominate all food flows. Now the giant packing houses have become COVID-19 hot zones, comprising two dozen out of some 200 major complexes: 6,600 workers are sick or otherwise off the job; 20 workers and 2 inspectors have died. There is rightly worry whether needed federal forces will be sent in to make the plants safe. Plus, the executive order does not address milk now going down the drain. It does not indemnify farmers for their euthanized animals, without which they will be ruined. Today, ranchers who had been at the Schiller Institute’s weekend conference panel on the “Science of Physical Economy,” proposed many specifics for what must happen now. For example, there are about 1,900 smaller meat-processing plants in the U.S. Build them up with credit and other measures. Back the full range of food preservation technologies, including irradiation. This thinking amounts to making concrete, in areas of special knowledge, a new paradigm of economic activity. There is similar momentum in other areas. Two of those farmers who attended the Schiller conference will participate on the April 30 LaRouchePAC Fireside Chat, with activists from all over the country, and an international conference call among farmers is in the process of being organized soon. In the international context, look at such a dramatic specific as how U.S. pork capacity could right now help supply China, where there is a great shortage because China lost up to half its hogs to African swine fever over 2018-2019. The logistics would be worked out, despite the pandemic. But the geopolitical residue of tariffs is still in the way. Moreover, look at the emergency task of how to supply “daily bread” for hundreds of millions of people in Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America/Caribbean, now hit by the pandemic on top of already insufficient food. A work-up of the tonnages and types of emergency foodstuffs required—not just abstract “money” terms—is under preparation for the Schiller Institute for international discussion. It is this “new paradigm” discussion process, exemplified in the food question, but also in other ways, manifest in the April 25-26 Schiller weekend, that is part of the target for attempted obliteration by the frantic British intelligence campaign now underway to demonize China, Russia, Iran and take down the U.S. Presidency. Each hour brings new extremes condemning China for lying and worse, not because of anything China has done or not done, but because time has run out for those behind the dead geopolitical/monetarist system. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave a press conference trying to again pitch his “We will use every tool to save you,” while Americans look on in growing anger at the obvious instantaneous bail-out of any Wall Street bum, but everyday essential businesses and livelihoods are crushed.",1,1,,,,,,,2388073104748491,/story.php?story_fbid=2388073104748491&id=2162254587330345

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-04-12 09:46:04,"""The doctrine of the immortality of the soul has a rich history, from Plato's Socratic dialogues, through the role of the same Platonic notion of the term agape expressed summarily by Paul's I Corinthians 13, and permeating the Gospel of John. It is the concept, translated as promotion of the general welfare of present and future generations, in the U.S. Constitution, and, otherwise, the notion of doing good in service of the common good. Our concern for humanity is not like a farmer's dedication to improving his breed of cattle; our concern is for the benefit to every soul, not only the living and the future, but also the past, in humanity as a whole. Like the true Christian missionary, he acts not to rule, but to serve in ways which enable humanity to rule itself better, for the sake of all souls, past, present, and future. ""The same rule applies to those whose profession is merely to be a hand of Providence. We are motivated by the sense that we are therefore living forever in each moment of mortal life. ""Thus, we see the mission from Jesus Christ, shining out from the site of the crucifixion. It is that radiation of agape, as identified by John and Paul, which has been the continuing benefit of an idea radiating throughout the intervening millennia to us today. So, experience the St. Matthew Passion [this is a piece Bach, very beautiful -APC], and leave that experience better people than you entered. Receive the message, and act accordingly.

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-04-22 12:28:18,"The Henry Jackson Society in London, which, together with the Atlantic Council in Washington, represents a core unit in the British Empire’s desperate effort to break President Donald Trump’s effort to build friendly relations with Russia and China, held a virtual forum on Monday under the title: “The Atlantic Alliance During a New Age of Great Power Competition.” The American, British and Czech speakers were not subtle about the intention: Europe and America must build “collective diplomacy” and a “Trans-Atlantic consortium” to win a war—their words—between “the Free World and China.” China is winning, they screamed, using their Belt and Road Initiative to build infrastructure, their Health Silk Road to help fight the pandemic, and their superior technology with Huawei, to infiltrate Western nations, spy on everyone, impose their authoritarian form of government, and destroy the Western liberal system. Serbia, Hungary and Italy have become virtual Chinese puppets, they whine, and more nations are being drawn in every day—if they are not stopped. In the U.S., President Trump partially submitted to the madness from those around him who argue that China intentionally created the virus, infected their own people, and sent those infected around the world, in order to destroy the Western economies through a pandemic. Pressed by the “fake news press” on this claim during his April 18 press briefing, Trump responded: “If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences.” Immediately the press issued headlines such as: “Trump Pushes Narrative That China Was Knowingly Responsible for Coronavirus” (Rolling Stone), while Steve Bannon lied to Fox TV that Trump had actually asserted it: “This is about the Chinese Communist Party, and they are ‘knowingly responsible’ for what happened. This is an act of commission.” Military-linked blogs have simply asserted that we are in an undeclared war with China. Former Iraq WMD inspector Scott Ritter, who has been a whistleblower against neo-con lies dragging the U.S. into wars, warned that the accusation against the Wuhan Virology Lab, for which no one—repeat, no one—has provided even a hint of evidence, is no different than Colin Powell’s infamous Feb. 5, 2003 UN speech, holding up a tube of anthrax, and showing pictures of a trailer, as justification for a genocidal war against Iraq, a war which President Trump has rightly declared to be the worst mistake in American history. China is increasingly furious over the lies and open threats of war, as well they should be. But their complaints are always joined by a plea for cooperation, at a time when the world desperately needs the great powers, and especially the U.S., China and Russia, to cooperate in stopping COVID-19. The World Food Program warned today that the number of people suffering from “acute food insecurity” is expected to double, to 265 million souls, in 2020, while their Senior Economist Arif Husain told reporters today: “COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread. It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage.” Will humanity tolerate such a humanitarian disaster, a Black Death in the 21st century? Or worse, will the human race accept this while being led into a global war between the nations whose cooperation is most essential to prevent such a holocaust? These questions will likely be answered in the coming weeks and months. It is urgent that everyone reading this editorial, from every nation on Earth, attend the International Schiller Institute Conference this coming weekend, April 25-26, beginning at 10:00 a.m. EDT (14:00 UTC), where this question of existential importance for mankind is the only issue on the agenda, from the perspective of strategy, science, culture and economics.

Lyndon LaRouche insisted, however, that any discussion of healthcare outside the context of massive physical economic development, breakthroughs in fundamental science and our understanding of the laws of the universe, rising productivity and rising wages, is mentally deficient. President Trump clearly has the idea of this when he keeps talking about economic expansion as the prerequisite for any discussion of entitlement reform.""",4,4,,,,,,,2372119283010540,/story.php?story_fbid=2372119283010540&id=2162254587330345
"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-04-06 15:53:39,"In the United States on Sunday its Surgeon-General Dr. Jerome Adams appeared on “Fox News Sunday” program to warn Americans that as the coronavirus pandemic rises toward a peak this week, “it will be a Pearl Harbor shock, a 9/11 shock”—“the hardest and saddest week of most Americans’ lives.” We should remember that for two full years before the original Pearl Harbor shock President Franklin Roosevelt was mobilizing logistics and production aid from America to other nations which were fighting the Axis powers. That aid was accelerated and expanded after the Pearl Harbor attack. Americans should hear President Donald Trump’s statements—almost never reported otherwise—at his daily task force conferences, that he wants to export medical equipment and supplies as soon as it is possible to the “151 countries that have this deadly virus.” Not only must supplies be sent: A new healthcare infrastructure must be built in most underdeveloped nations, which are almost totally unprepared. This will only happen if the President reaches agreements with the leading producer nations China, Russia, India and others, to create credit and mobilize production. As a long-time pandemic researcher, Laurie Garrett, said in an interview April 3, only if the United States and China cooperate to build up the developing countries is there any hope that they will not be completely devastated by this pandemic in coming months, which will then “come back to us.” Schiller Institute President Helga Zepp-LaRouche again on Saturday urged, in an international internet dialogue, “‘All Men Shall Be Brothers’: From COVID-19 to the New Paradigm,” an immediate summit of the heads of those leading producer nations, to accomplish a new credit system and a new paradigm. She said, “I think that you should put yourself also in the shoes of the people in the developing countries who are at the very end of the chain: People who have only one meal a day, or have no clean water, or who suffer from malnutrition. I think it’s really important, because they cannot fight for themselves, it is up to us. And Nicholas of Cusa already said this in the 15th century, that there are so many people who cannot really take responsibility for what comes out of history, because they’re so much under the burden of fighting for their livelihood, for just getting enough food, or living, that they have no additional energy. And people who are suffering hunger, that is the worst violation of human rights. People are in pain. If they die of hunger, it’s the most painful death you can imagine: And I think this is a moment where it really depends on us, who are in the so-called advanced sector—which is not so advanced, after all—but we have certain privileges that we can even have this kind of discussion, that we can have the kind of international communication that we can think about what to do: And out of that comes a tremendous responsibility. “And I think this is a moment where people really have to rethink how they relate to the rest of humanity, by consciously strengthening your sense of empathy. When Friedrich Schiller would say, in his lifetime, looking at the situation around him, he said the most important requirement of my time (meaning his time), is the development of what is in German, the Empfindungsvermögen, which can be roughly translated as ‘empathy,’ as taking the mind and soul of the other person into your heart and making it your own; finding out all the feelings and thinking of the other person, and to develop that passion and compassion and empathy with the people who cannot do it right now. I think if we do that, then we will come out of this crisis as better human beings, and that is, we have to absolutely develop this idea of empathy and love for all of humanity. “And if we do that we will be immortal and invincible.... “I think that that is not a utopia. I think that this present crisis brings us to the test, and also the chance to make that big step forward in the history and in the evolution of the human species.”",,,,,,,,,2369813066574495,/story.php?story_fbid=2369813066574495&id=2162254587330345

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-03-31 14:24:06,"China-U.S. collaboration after the March 26 G20 and phone discussions between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jining may now fundamentally change the materials-logistics situation in the coronavirus fight at least in the United States and probably internationally. President Trump spoke at his Monday afternoon press conference today about additional day-to-day cooperation with Russia after a phone discussion with President Vladimir Putin; and of another conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, a destination for increasing U.S. aid against the coronavirus. Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump on March 29 in the Rose Garden spoke of 50-60 big cargo planes full of medical equipment coming from all over the world in April and landing at JFK Airport in New York and Los Angeles Airport—“the Project Airbridge.” The President repeated the formulation Monday afternoon, but “all over the world” probably means largely from China. On Monday Trump also named Russia as having sent a “very, very large planeload” of medical supplies to the United States; and he added that planes will be going back out with aid for other nations, naming Italy, Spain, and France. In a statement released Sunday night, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that it had received “30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and 1 million doses of chloroquine phosphate donated to a national stockpile of potentially life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.” Presidents Vladimir Putin and Trump spoke on Monday morning. The White House and Kremlin statements said they agreed on the importance of stabilizing the global energy markets, and that they would work through the G20 nations to combat the coronavirus and reinvigorate the global economy. Just a day before, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, had implied in a March 27 interview with Reuters, that a new oil production agreement could be reached between Russia and Saudi Arabia if President Trump and other “OPEC-plus” leaders became involved, telling the news agency: “Efforts to restore relations between Russia and the United States are now as important as ever, we will take all the efforts our side and hope the United States will also understand that this is necessary.” And President Trump, talking to Fox News early Monday morning about his upcoming call with Putin, stressed the World War II fighting alliance between America and Russia, something almost banned from public discourse by major U.S. media today. Otherwise the Sunday, March 29 press conference saw the President drop entirely the idea of opening up the economy quickly, and defer to medical advisors Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, and other epidemiological experts who met with him Sunday morning and presented a new model of the virus curve in the United States. This model evidently foresaw 2.2 million American deaths from COVID-19 without the current mitigation strategy; and between 160,000 and 220,000 deaths if the full mitigation strategy is continued, with testing being rapidly increased further and contact tracing beginning in less hard-hit areas. Trump said: “We had an aspiration of Easter. But when you hear these kind of numbers and you hear the potential travesty, we don’t want to do anything where ... we don’t want to have a spike up. ... This—again, 151 countries. And we’re going to do it. We’re going to have a great victory.

At the same time, from place to place, the degree of logistics mobilization is on a wartime scale. This point was dramatized in the United States over the weekend, for example, by President Donald Trump personally standing dockside for the departure from Norfolk—the U.S. NATO center—of USNS Comfort hospital ship for New York City to arrive tomorrow. Similarly, on Friday, March 27, New York Gov.

Cuomo profusely thanked the National Guard and Army Corps of Engineers for their work. But make no mistake. The decades of takedown of medical delivery infrastructure and public health systems in the trans-Atlantic, and prevention of build-up in Africa, in large parts of the Western Hemisphere, South Asia, and elsewhere, means that huge gaps remain in the capacity to protect life. As we fight like hell to save lives, we must further the fight that can win the establishment of a new, humanity-serving economic system. This was discussed in yesterday’s LaRouchePAC webcast, “An Apollo Mission To Save Mankind: Building the Health Silk Road,” keynoted by Schiller Institute President Helga Zepp-LaRouche. She reiterated her call to suspend the out-of-control stock markets, and take emergency financial reorganization measures. Do this in the context of deliberation among great power leaders, Presidents Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the earliest possible summit. In opposition to any such moves for a new system, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin today repeatedly stressed that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank would pump liquidity into the Wall Street/City of London dead system, like gasoline on a fire. Mnuchin said, “I talk to (Fed Chairman Jerome) Powell every day. He tells me what he needs. I have never turned him down.” Mnuchin continued, “We have $4 trillion of liquidity ... that is being rolled out in these (Fed) programs.” In other words, while Mnuchin talks the talk of helping “Mainstreet America”—and Federal assistance is truly in order to workers, farmers, aid to hospitals, local and state governments and so on, in the new CARES Act that Trump signed on Friday—Mnuchin is really walking the walk to Hell. Impetus for a new world economic system is coming from calls for debt relief and reorganization in Africa and South America. This weekend, for example, Alicia Bárcena, Director of UN Economic Commission on Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said, “We have to re-think what type of development model should emerge from this crisis.” It is necessary to “re-think globalization.” The Latin American Strategic Center for Geopolitics (CELAG) called for forgiveness of the sovereign debt of Ibero-American nations by the multilateral lenders, such as the IMF, World Bank, etc., and by private creditors too. From Africa, the Bureau of the African Union Heads of State and Government issued a Communiqué March 26, before the G20 Summit, calling for taking the necessary economic measures to deal with COVID-19 and all diseases. Only since January 2017 has Africa even had a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and five regional sub-units. These calls can be answered. The existing neo-British Empire monetarist system that created vulnerability to disease and suffering can be shut down forevermore. And on defeating the virus, a symbol of hope came today, in the personal visit Xi Jinping made to two big ports in Zhejiang Province, south of Shanghai, and other locations where post-COVID 19 economic activity is now resuming. Vigilance against disease resurgence is still required, but that can be done. Internationally, China is playing a leading part in providing aid to dozens of countries in their battle against COVID-19, and there are other critical instances, e.g. Russian assistance in Italy. This collaborative spirit is present between Xi and Trump, as shown in their phone call last Thursday. Today, at the White House meeting with business leaders on supply chain questions, Trump pointed out that medical supplies are now being flown to the U.S. from China, and feeding into “Project Airbridge,” delivering supplies across the U.S. A planeload touched down in New York City from Shanghai this morning, the first of 20 such deliveries through April. Across the United States, there is a deepening collaborative spirit, which the governors and President Trump and the White House showed in many ways over the weekend in the several virus hotspot zones. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Chairman of the National Governors Association, said on Fox News, there may be “big pinch points” in lack of test kits, masks, and ventilators, and “there is frustration out there,” but, “We’re all in this together.”",1,1,,,,,,,2364578170431318,/story.php?story_fbid=2364578170431318&id=2162254587330345

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-03-28 18:01:56,"The presidents and prime ministers of the Group of 20 nations clearly wanted to cooperate to speed up the defeat of the COVID-19 virus all over the world, when they met on a long teleconference today, and to expand their aid to developing countries which lack public health capacities. “We are gravely concerned with the serious risks posed to all countries, particularly developing and least developed countries, and notably in Africa and small island states, where health systems and economies may be less able to cope with the challenge, as well as the particular risk faced by refugees and displaced persons. We will strengthen capacity building.... We stand ready to mobilize development and humanitarian financing.” And they pledged to conduct expanded, frontier scientific research together to save human lives from deadly pandemics. For weeks before this teleconference Schiller Institute President Helga Zepp-LaRouche had urged for the four key leaders on that call—U.S. President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi—to meet. She called on them to jointly create credit for just such efforts, including hospital building worldwide, and scientific crash programs, through cooperation of national banks in each country. And she urged them temporarily to close the lately collapsing securities markets and stop all bailouts to those markets and the Wall Street and City of London banks. After the G20 telemeeting today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry explained that the nations on that call had spent and/or had now committed $5 trillion toward reviving economies collapsed by the pandemic’s impact—$3.5 trillion of it by the governments of the United States and China. But a single central bank, the Federal Reserve, had printed and/or committed to print at least $5.2 trillion to buy the failing assets from City of London and Wall Street banks, hedge funds, you name it; and is also providing additional dollar “swap lines” with other central banks to do the same. This inhuman waste has to stop; it is costing many lives, and when hyperinflation results, it will cost many more. Government taxes and borrowing are backing this immense financial bailout instead of backing national bank credit to build and equip modern hospitals in developing nations and create new high-technology infrastructure in industrial ones. LaRouchePAC says “Triage Wall Street—Not Grandma.” Helga Zepp-LaRouche insists the pandemic can be defeated, but only by throwing out the London monetary virus, the “floating exchange rate” system of the past 50 years. Implement the Four Laws of Lyndon LaRouche beginning with Glass-Steagall breakup of Wall Street- and City of London-centered financial firms and creation of Hamiltonian national credit institutions in each major nation. Create a fixed-exchange-rate, Bretton Woods-type credit system to export capital goods, led by those modern hospitals, to poorer nations. Put people first. Kill the British Malthusian virus as well—the one that let loose from Imperial College the anti-human “herd immunity” idea that 60% of every population had to get this coronavirus. This idea was angrily rejected by President Donald Trump yesterday when he said “I don’t accept a single death,” and equally angrily by his scientific advisor Dr. Deborah Birx. On May 20, 2002 Lyndon LaRouche, who with his movement had been involved from 1995-2001 in a mass mobilization to save the capital’s only public hospital, D.C. General Hospital, from being shut down, along with thousands of other hospitals nationwide, said: “Over a period of more than three decades to the present date, there had been a trend in national policy and practice, away from the Constitutional commitment to promotion of the general welfare, toward an increasingly radical notion of what is sometimes named ‘shareholder value.’ With the rising flood-tide of global monetary-financial and economic crises, the United States, like other nations, is being impelled, of necessity, to return to what some prefer to name as ‘protectionist’ measures, and to economy-rebuilding policies referencing successful features of the U.S.-led recovery and reconstruction programs of the Americas, Europe, and Japan during various phases of approximately the 1933-1965 interval.” That is the “New Bretton Woods” system, like President Franklin Roosevelt’s, that Helga Zepp-LaRouche demands we return to now, in time to save our lives. And LaRouche continued: “For a period of nearly thirty years, our nation’s health-care system has been increasingly the victim of a misguided shift from the system developed under the Hill-Burton law, to the presently evolved HMO system. It should be recalled today, that the Hill-Burton legislation was adopted under the impetus of the experience of our participation in two World Wars. Thus, Hill-Burton reflected an included awareness of the kind of health-care capabilities wanted to deal, inclusively, with health-care and related challenges of even traumatic national-security characteristics. That included awareness must be reawakened in legislative and other relevant practice under the increasingly strategically perilous conditions of today.”",1,1,,,,,,,2363107000578435,/story.php?story_fbid=2363107000578435&id=2162254587330345
"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-03-23 13:21:40,"Often, the single biggest obstacle to solving a problem is misidentifying its cause. This is especially the case during times of great social and economic turmoil, of a “phase shift,” such as today. The old “rules of the game” have stopped working, including those that seemed to explain cause-and-effect in normal times. Yet many people, even well-meaning ones, fall back on old, dysfunctional ways of thinking about how the world actually works. Why is there a global coronavirus pandemic? It is not because “the Chinese like to eat live bats”; it’s not because some nasty intelligence agency cooked up a biological weapon in a secret lab somewhere (although the open advocacy of such Malthusian genocide by the likes of Prince Philip gives pause for thought); and it’s not because these are “natural phenomena” that always happen, that you just have to let run their course. The world is being swept by a coronavirus pandemic today for precisely the reasons Lyndon LaRouche warned this would happen, and for none other: a drop in mankind’s potential relative population-density to levels consistently and dramatically below the actual population. That occurs, LaRouche specified, as a result of financial and economic policies that favor speculation over scientific and technological breakthroughs, and associated expanded physical-economic production. In a Jan. 17, 1998 speech to a Schiller Institute conference in Virginia, LaRouche warned: “We are on the edge of the greatest financial collapse known in the history of European civilization since the Fourteenth Century, what was called the New Dark Age, part of a process in which approximately half the population of Europe was wiped out through disease and famine, and various kinds of insanity. The culmination of that, then, as today, was a collapse of the financial, banking system, the so-called Lombard banking system. During that period, half of the municipalities, the parishes of Europe, vanished. One-third of the population of Europe, in a fairly short period of time, vanished of disease, and famine, and strife. We are on the verge of such things, not only in Asia, not only in South America, but here in the United States itself. Not some time in the next century, but this year.” In that same address, LaRouche stated: “Look about us. Don’t take one event at a time and try to explain it. Look at the process.” The deadly coronavirus threatening the human species, and the equally deadly $1.8 quadrillion financial cancer that has metastasized throughout the trans-Atlantic financial system, are part of the same process—they are effects produced by the same cause, and therefore subject to the same solution. Lyndon LaRouche once called for politically burying Wall Street and the City of London so deep, that you wouldn’t even be able to smell the stench anymore. That burial has a name: it is called Glass-Steagall—the bankruptcy reorganization of a cancerous trans-Atlantic financial system to put the speculative assets in deep freeze, while maintaining the vital functions of commercial banks related to the population and essential physical production. Simultaneously with that measure, Lyndon LaRouche specified in his famous Four Laws, it is necessary to establish Hamiltonian national credit systems to fund actual development; create a New Bretton Woods system to jointly promote high-productivity global infrastructure projects such as the World Land-Bridge; and foster advanced scientific research in fields such as fusion, space sciences, and optical biophysics. That argument was summarized in remarks on March 21 by his widow, Helga Zepp-LaRouche: “You have to go for Glass-Steagall; now! Don’t wait! Don’t put it on the back burner. President Trump promised in the 2016 election campaign many times that he would implement Glass-Steagall, and now is exactly the moment to do it. “What that means is the exact same measures like those of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 must be implemented exactly like that. My late husband always stressed, ‘Don’t change a thing.’ The arguments that the markets today are more complicated and they need derivatives, he always categorically rejected that. Basically it would mean that you put a firewall between the commercial banks and the investment banks; and put the commercial banks under state protection so that they can continue to provide credit to the real economy, the small- and medium-sized firms, trade, retail, all these things which are essential for the real economy. But you separate the investment banks completely. That means the investment banks should no longer have access to the savings of the commercial banks, and they should not be bailed out through taxpayer money. “Since some of these products are complicated, because the pension funds and other valid things which belong to the life savings of the people, in the meantime, are interwoven with the derivatives and the whole casino aspect of the financial system. This is why you have to have a pause; you have to freeze everything and then a state commission has to investigate what is valid in those assets and they have to be protected and separated. That may be complicated, but it has to be done. “Then, obviously, if you eliminate the investment bank part of the financial system, you won’t have enough liquidity. And this is why Mr. LaRouche said this is the moment when you have to re-establish Hamiltonian banking, you have to establish a national bank—not only in one country but practically in all countries—and then you have to connect those national banks through fixed exchange rates. You have to make long-term agreements among them for investments in well-defined projects of reconstruction; reconstruction of the health sector, protecting and rebuilding sovereignty in the agricultural area to reconstruct war-torn regions like Southwest Asia. Remedy for good the reasons why the African continent and other countries from the Southern Hemisphere are so vulnerable; which means you have to, in earnest, start industrializing these countries, the countries of Africa and countries of Latin America and Asia, and you have to help them to build infrastructure as the precondition for industrial production and the development of agriculture. “And that way you create the conditions to create a sufficient health system in every country. All of that has to be done simultaneously, and obviously it will not go smoothly, but if you don’t go in this direction, the danger is that not only the coronavirus will come back with a vengeance, but there is absolutely nothing which will prevent the outbreak of new viruses and new diseases. “And therefore, this is an absolute must that we correct the mistakes of the last several decades, especially the last 30 years of deregulation of the markets, of giving every right to the speculators and cutting down on the common good.” That was Lyndon LaRouche’s policy recommendation for rooting out the cause of the problems we face.",1,,,1,,,,,2359018144320654,/story.php?story_fbid=2359018144320654&id=2162254587330345
"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Bruce Todd,PATRIOTS AGAINST THE EMPIRE!",,2020-02-12 20:50:41,"National Security Council Being Fumigated—Swamp Creatures Reassigned Feb. 11 (EIRNS)—The National Security Council confirmed yesterday that it is proceeding to reduce staff levels, down from the bloated level of 400 reached under the Obama administration, the Washington Times reported today. It is a welcomed move, given that the NSC has harbored a number of nasty foreign intelligence agents and other allied swamp creatures who worked to subvert the Donald Trump Presidency. NSC spokesman John Ullyot said that this month, “we will complete the right-sizing goal” that NSC Adviser Robert O’Brien outlined last October, “and in fact may exceed that target by drawing down even more positions.” O’Brien had said that he wanted to reduce the staff to fewer than 120 positions by early this year. More than 40 staffers were already moved out last December, and another 70 are expected to be reassigned this week. This couldn’t come too soon for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, who told the Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures” program with Maria Bartiromo Feb. 9 that the NSC was responsible for undermining the President. “I’ve been saying for a long time,” Nunes elaborated, “that the National Security Council … there at the White House, 400 and some people, he would be best to take all of those people, ship them across the Potomac, quarantine them, get them the hell away from the White House, because we know that a lot of the leaks for the last three-plus years, have been coming from that National Security Council.” According to the Washington Examiner, Nunes is also targetting Justice Department Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who changed the whistleblower statute to allow for the hearsay “revelations” from the infamous whistleblower about Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky which unleashed the impeachment inquiry. Nunes has written to Atkinson, giving him until Feb. 14 to hand over “documentary evidence” on the “unusual handling” of the whistleblower’s complaint, or otherwise he would refer the matter to the DOJ",,,,,,,,,2328186237403845,/story.php?story_fbid=2328186237403845&id=2162254587330345

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2020-02-05 17:55:48,"Tuesday night, during his State of the Union address, President Trump called for full funding of Project Artemis, his bold space vision to return to the Moon. This is the critical first step to the next level of economic development for the human species, including an interplanetary fusion economy and mankind’s colonization of Mars and the rest of the Solar System. As was demonstrated by the Apollo Moon missions, the exploration of space is the most important and effective driver of science, technology, economic growth, and cultural optimism. The Apollo Program produced profound breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields too numerous to list, and expanded our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe. For every $1 spent on the manned space mission, our economy gained $10 right here on Earth, because of the technological improvements that mission demanded. Trump sees America’s return to space critical to our future: “In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts — using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.” However, the Artemis project has been subject to concerted attacks in Congress. One such assault on the scientific future of our nation—and the world—is H.R. 5666, a bill sponsored by the chair of the House Subcommittee on Science and Aeronautics, Rep. Kendra Horn (D-OK). This bill cuts funding to Project Artemis, jeopardizing the progress it has already made, and the program as a whole. It explicitly states that Artemis should not develop the resources of the Moon. This outlook is wrong. The Moon’s surface is loaded with resources, including oxygen, water, metals, and a special resource unique to the Moon, helium-3. This special type of hydrogen is absent from the Earth, but present in relative abundance on our celestial neighbor. It is considered the best fuel for fusion, an inexhaustible and high-powered energy source that can literally power the entire Earth without waste while transforming our relationship to natural resources. Instead, H.R. 5666 argues, we should ignore the many benefits of developing lunar resources and infrastructure and instead go directly to Mars. In an exchange with LaRouche PAC leader Kesha Rogers, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine emphasized the significance of the 2024 date for landing on the Moon: “You [Kesha Rogers] mentioned 2024, and some people have said maybe that’s a partisan date. Remember what Kennedy said: ‘by the end of the decade.’ He gave it a date. Why? Because that’s how you get results.” Bridenstine continued: “Here’s the important thing: NASA doesn’t have a science problem or a technical problem. We can retire all the technical risk you can imagine: We’re an amazing agency with amazing engineers. We have a political problem! That’s why we are not at the Moon right now, that’s why we are not on Mars right now.” The “political problem” referred to by Bridenstine has been the result of a sustained attack on our nation's manned space program, an attack that started long before Trump took office. The neo-Malthusian, zero-growth attitude, coupled with deadly pragmatism has crippled our space program, robbing Americans of the optimism, scientific progress, and creative discovery uniquely associated with the exploration of space. This insanity is coupled with rabid and irrational hatred of President Trump generated by constant 24 hour a day propaganda portraying him as a monster. As a result, Congress is chipping away at Artemis, saying that if this President proposes producing a bountiful and optimistic future for you and your children, it must not happen because this President proposed it. LaRouche PAC is going to fight for full implementation of the Artemis program. It is the type of challenge and vision that can unite our population and fire the imaginations and creativity of our youth. It is a mission in which we fulfill and celebrate the nature of human beings, the gift to our species of creative thought, the ability to transform the universe—unlike the pessimism and decadence which have persisted in our society since the last great space exploration program was killed. It is the basis for cooperation with Russia, China, and India, in a grand mission to understand and develop the universe in which we all live, replacing the primitive and stupid idea of endless wars over resources and geopolitics. Upon President Trump’s announcement of the Artemis Program, LaRouche PAC has taken its support for this very important initiative to the streets in a big way, to organize the American people in full support of this critical mission. We continue to circulate a petition and accompanying report under the headline “We Commit to the Moon–Mars Mission.” The report begins: “A 50-year, international crash program for lunar industrialization, the development of fusion-powered space flight, and Mars colonization will be the most important driver for the U.S. and global economies. President Trump’s plan to return to the Moon by 2024 is the correct first step; let’s see the full program through.” The great visionaries of our space program did not merely see the program as meeting short-term goals or deadlines, but as setting a standard for true economic and scientific progress for all of humankind. The achievement of a permanent lunar presence is the gateway to the development of a human economy in space. Will you join us now, in the fight to implement this great adventure? Lifting our eyes to the stars will heal this nation’s present destructive partisan wounds. Like President Kennedy’s challenge to the nation to go to the Moon, today’s Moon–Mars mission is a necessary challenge for achieving a future worthy of all human beings on planet Earth, and, soon, beyond.",8,6,,2,,,,,2322897874599348,/story.php?story_fbid=2322897874599348&id=2162254587330345
"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Anthony Enos Wicher,PATRIOTS AGAINST THE EMPIRE!",,2020-01-30 16:13:20,"Volume 7, Number 21EIR Daily Alert ServiceP.O. BOX 17390, WASHINGTON, DC 20041-0390· · · · · · · · · · n coup plotters deploying against President Donald Trump and the American electorate, predictably turned to the to preview John Bolton’s “memoirs,” to try to pump some life into their efforts for a regime change in the U.S. In her weekly webcast, Helga Zepp- LaRouche said this is a sign of desperation, as their case has been effectively refuted by Trump’s legal team, and a significant segment of thel assault on the institution of the Presidency, and the increasing difficulty they are having to cover the cost of basic necessities.The level of political ferment in the U.S., and the overt hostility to the long-dominant Washington Establishment, were on display at a campaign rally which President Trump held on Jan. 28 in Wildwood, N.J., where tens of thousands braved the rain and cold to hear him speak. “I think it is very clear that this [impeachment] is not functioning with the American people,” Zepp-LaRouche said. There is similar ferment breaking out across Europe and other parts of the planet, and the danger exists that it will lead to social chaos if solutions are not provided to the urgent security, economic and cultural issues facing mankind.The biggest danger faced by the imperial forces behind the coup has been Trump’s commitment to establish better relations with Russia and China. Not surprisingly, Bolton, one of those virulently opposed to this shift in U.S. strategic policy, is now being embraced by the same Democrats who in the past denounced him as a dishonest war-hawk. proposal for an urgent summit among, minimally, the Presidents of the U.S., Russia and China. And it has to bring real economic development into the region.“Look at the result of what President Trump clearly wants to end, namely, these endless wars,” Zepp-LaRouche explained. “Therefore, if you want to reconstruct this area and have a durable peace, what you need is an economic development for the entire Southwest Asian region, and that can only happen if all the great powers work together. I think the immediate perspective is given, because the Chinese have offered to Afghanistan, toIraq, to Syria, to extend the New Silk Road. Also the Arabs have many interests of cooperation along the Silk Road with China. That is the only way how you can have the hope to calm down this region. And rather than trying to continue geopolitical games, I think all the great powers—Russia, China, India, the United States, European countries—they should all join hands and reconstruct this area, and then you can have the hope for peace.”l Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and continued to take high-profile, personal leadership in his country’s battle against the novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV).“China has full confidence and capability to win the battle,” Xi stated, “The Chinese people are now fighting a very serious battle against the epidemic,” Xi said, and “the prevention and control of the outbreak is the country’s most important work for now.” He stressed that “China is ready to work with the WHO as well as the international community to safeguard regional and global public health security.”Dr. Tedros was effusive in his praise of what China has done to date.Xinhua reported that “Tedros said it is admirable that the Chinese government has shown its solid political resolve and taken timely and effective measures in dealing with the epidemic. President Xi’s personal guidance and deployment show his great leadership capability, Tedros said. He said that China has released information in an open and transparent manner, identified the pathogen in a record-short time and shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus in a timely manner with the WHO and other countries.”Tedros went further, observing that “China’s measures are not only protecting its people, but also protecting the people in the whole world,”according to Xinhua. “The high speed and massive scale of China’s moves are rarely seen in the world, Tedros said, which showed China’s efficiency and the advantages of China’s system. The experience of China is worth learning for other countries.” Tedros concluded, “The WHO firmly supports China’s measures against the epidemic and stands ready to enhance cooperation with China and provide all necessary assistance.”os has announced that it will be launching a nuclear power “space tug” by 2030. The announcement was made in apresentation by Roscosmos First Deputy Director General Yuri Urlichich atthe 44th Korolev Academic Space Conference, reported TASS.ed space vehicle must enter serial production and commercial use, it says. This involves building a testing and experimenting facility and the perfecting of a nuclear engine on the ground, including conducting resource tests. A mock-up engine is scheduled for this year.Initially, Rosatom had planned to build a test, megawatt nuclear propulsion engine for distant space travel by 2018, which was to be installed on a spacecraft, codenamed “transport energy module.” The work commenced in 2009.nt Donald Trump held a campaign rally at the Wildwood Convention Center on the South Jersey Shore, a New Jersey beach town (year-round population of under 5,500 people) which caters to not-wealthy families. Trump told the rally that some people had advised him to hold this rally in the far bigger Meadowlands Arena in North Jersey, but he had said no, “I want to be with our friends in South Jersey.” LaRouche activists attended the rally in force.The turn-out was huge, primarily by the working people Hillary Clinton had dismissed in 2016 as “deplorables.” Somewhere between 160-175,000 people requested tickets to attend the rally; the hall overflowed its normal capacity of 7,500. People started arriving 48 hours in advance; hundreds and hundreds camped out overnight in the January cold. Tens of thousands of those who couldn’t get in watched the rally on a big screen outside, and the town’s bars were full of others watching it on live television.onal antics of Pelosi et al., that he then switched parties to join Trump’s Republican Party.Trump’s campaign manager reported that 26.3% of the people requesting tickets were self-described Democrats, and over 10% of them did not vote in the 2016 election. He called the numbers overall, “mind boggling.” Noting these figures, the wrote that “almost half of the attendees at Trump’s recent rally in Ohio identified themselves as Democrats or independents, and almost 60% identified the same way at a rally in Wisconsin.” defense presented by Trump’s lawyers yesterday, the House Democrats are now hanging their hopes of getting extra mileage for their impeachment circus by waiting for former National Security Adviser John Bolton to, hopefully, testify next week. The Senate is expected to vote on Jan. 31 on whether to accept witnesses, including Bolton.President Trump was not waiting around for that. Earlier today he tweeted about Bolton: “For a guy who couldn’t get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago, couldn’t get approved for anything since, ‘begged’ me for a non Senate approved job, which I gave him despitemany saying ‘Don’t do it, sir,’ takes the job, mistakenly says ‘Libyan Model’ on T.V., and many more mistakes of judgement, gets fired because frankly, if I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now, and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?”A Jan. 23 letter to Bolton’s lawyer from National Security Council Senior Director for Records, Access, and Information Security Management Ellen J. Knight, which was made public by Associated Press today, informs him that the manuscript of Bolton’s kiss-and-tell book that they are reviewing for clearance “appears to contain significant amounts of classified information. It also appears that some of this classified information is at the TOP SECRET level, which [can] ... ‘reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security’ of the United States if disclosed without authorization.”Trump’s attorneys concluded their opening arguments on Jan. 28 with a brief, two-hour presentation, hammering at the impeachment as an attempted re-run of the 2016 election. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said: “What they are asking you to do is to throw out a successful President on the eve of an election, with no basis, and in violation of the Constitution. Why not trust the American people with this decision? Why tear up their ballots?... Overturning the last election and massively interfering with the upcoming one would cause serious and lasting damage to the people of the United States and our great country The Senate cannot allow this tohappen. It is time for this to end, here and now.”reported that “Trump’s attorneys used roughly 11 of the 24 hours allotted to them over three days to present their case,” as compared to the endless droning from the Democrats, who used up nearly every minute allocated to them.Sen. Lindsey Graham responded to the Democrats’ insistence on calling more witnesses, such as Bolton. “I’ll make a prediction. There will be 51 Republican votes to call Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the whistleblower and the DNC staffer at a minimum.”ry of State Mike Pompeo spoke by phone with top diplomat and State Councillor Yang Jiechi today. He offered his condolences for the Chinese citizens who had lost their lives to the novel coronavirus and thanked Yang for his assistance in evacuating Americans from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus’s spread.More than 200 Americans were evacuated from Wuhan, going through the obligatory medical checks before leaving the city and then again when they arrived in Alaska, where they landed for refueling before reaching their March air base in California, where were again medically checked.Beijing had facilitated the evacuation, which had prompted Secretary Pompeo’s call. University chemistry chair Prof. Charles Lieber was arrested on Jan. 28 and charged by the Department of Justice with allegedly lying about his connections with Chinese scientists. Although is not familiar with the legal specifics of this and similar cases, it is politically just the tip of a blitz campaign against U.S. researchers involved in projects with China. The DOJ is targeting, in particular, China’s “Thousand Talents” program, which was launched in 2008 to encourage Chinese and other researchers working abroad to come to China to use their talents to help develop the Chinese economy. The argument is being made by FBI Director Christopher Wray and others that China is intent on replacing the United States as the number-one world power and, by means of such a program, is thereby stealing “U.S. intellectual property.” Ergo, this becomes a national security issue. bring with them only their knowledge and their minds. This DOJ campaign, in effect, is a direct attack on the very notion of international scientific cooperation,which has served humanity so well through the ages, and has already sent a chilling message to those scientists hoping to work with China or in China.According to the DOJ, Professor Lieber allegedly accepted more than $1 million in grant money from Wuhan University to establish a lab and conduct research. Lieber is a prestigious chemist, who heads a lab with specialty in nanoscience, and holds appointments in both Harvard’s Chemistry Department, which he chairs, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In 2017, Harvard bestowed its highest faculty honor on Lieber, naming him a University Professor—a title he shared with only 25 other faculty members, reported the . But the acclaimed academic is now barred from the university’s campus. Harvard announced that “Professor Lieber has been placed on indefinite administrative leave.”Lieber, who received more than $15 million in grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Defense, reportedly failed to disclose that in 2011 he had joined Wuhan University of Technology in China as a scientist.“According to the court papers, he also participated in the Thousand Talents Plan, a program that aims to attract foreign research specialists. TheU.S. has flagged the program as a security concern in the past,” BBC reported.In related cases, two other researchers were arrested in the Boston area. Prosecutors said that Yanqing Ye, a Boston University robotics researcher, concealed the fact that she was in the Chinese army. Ms. Ye is accused of falsely identifying herself as a student and also continuing to work for the People’s Liberation Army, while completing a number of assignments in the U.S. Also, cancer researcher Zaosong Zheng was arrested at Boston’s Logan International Airport with 21 vials of biological samples in his luggage. Prosecutors allege he was planning to return to China to continue his research there.This is only the beginning, however. On Feb. 6 the Center for Strategic and International Studies, will hold a “China Initiative Conference,” with FBI Director Christopher Wray and keynoted by Attorney General WilliamBarr, “to fulfill the Department’s strategic priority of confronting national security threats presented by the People’s Republic of China, with a particular emphasis placed on the policies and practices that seek to challenge U.S. technological and scientific leadership.” today passed a bill which represents a further attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the People’s Republic of China. The legislation, entitled the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019, would provide more leeway for a China-obsessed Congress to make more trouble for the P.R.C. It would also place more strictures on the ability of the President to conduct the U.S. foreign relations with regard to China.le tool of the Western financial oligarchy.t guidelines. It’s almost as if they believe that Tibet must be regulated by the U.S. Congress.The legislation was introduced by Rep. James McGovern in the House and Sen. Marco Rubio in the Senate, the same characters who worked on those other two flagrant provocative interferences into China’s sovereignty, the Hong Kong bill and the Uighur bill. It must still be passed by the Senate, which is highly likely, albeit not inevitable, and be signed by the President. But, like the Hong Kong and Uighur bills, it is all geared to promote Tibetan independence and a break-up of China.The Chinese reaction was swift, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying condemning it: “This move has severely breached international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs, and sent a wrong message to ‘Tibet independence’ forces.” Tibetan affairs are purely internal affairs of China and admit no foreign interference, she insisted, urging theU.S. to fully recognize the high sensitivity of Tibet-related issues and to stop using them to interfere in P.R.C. internal affairs. Instead, she stated, Washington should do more to advance China-U.S. mutual trust and cooperation.an President Volodymyr Zelensky outraged Moscow during the Jan. 27 memorial observance in Poland on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp—by the Red Army—when he blamed Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union equally for having started World War II. The Poles “were the first to feel the consequences of the criminal collusion of the totalitarian regimes,” Zelensky said during a joint briefing with Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, reported AFP. “This led to the start of World War II and allowed the Nazis to launch the lethal Holocaust machine.”Zelensky’s remark, echoing earlier statements from political figures in Poland and elsewhere, not surprisingly set off a firestorm of criticism in Moscow.“We strongly disagree with this statement,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the following day. “The President of Ukraine identifies himself with the extremely erroneous, in our opinion, point of view of the Polish leadership and associates himself with a point of view that is offensive to tens of millions of Russians and citizens of formerSoviet countries, whose parents, grandfathers, and relatives gave their lives for the liberation of Europe, including Poland, from fascism.“Therefore, we do not accept this statement, we consider it incorrect and insulting from the point of view of the memory of our grandfathers,” Peskov continued.Angry responses also came from the Russian Duma, the lower house of Russia’s bicameral Federal Assembly.“Today we observe as the Ukrainian President disowns his grandfather and seeks to do everything to smear our mutual history in a bid to retain power and gain acknowledgment of several European countries and the U.S.,” said Duma Chairman Viacheslav Volodin.“Zelensky’s comments about the role of the Soviet Union in the outbreak of World War II suggests that Ukraine remains a territory governed by outside forces. In order to carry water for Kiev’s Western handlers, the Ukrainian leader has sided with an historical falsehood, instead of the truth,” said Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the Duma Foreign Affairs Committee. “This is shameful and blasphemous towards the memory of those who gave their lives fighting against Nazism.”Russian President Vladimir Putin has in recent weeks personally and repeatedly taken up the cudgels against this revisionist lie of blaming the Soviet Union for World War II.Jan. 29 (EIRNS)—A round of diplomatic meetings and talks are now beginning, following the announcement of President Donald Trump’snian peace settlement proposal. Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu left Washington to fly directly to Moscow, where he will brief Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 30 on his talks with President Trump and the peace plan, as was confirmed by the spokespersons of both leaders.The U.S. State Department released a statement saying that U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan will inform the Russian authorities about President Trump’s Middle East plan. accept Washington’s proposal but will at least start negotiations on its basis, that would be a common success, and I think it is not as important who suggested the plan in the first place.”Speaking on Palestinian national television, Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas told the nation on Jan. 28, that although they reject the peace plan, they will negotiate with Israel under the auspices of the “quartet” of international Middle East mediators comprised of Russia, the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union.“We accept negotiations with Israel under the auspices of the quartet,” Abbas said. “We adhere to negotiations on the basis of international legitimacy, and will not accept Washington as the only mediator in the Middle Eastern peace process,” he stated.He reiterated that a peace plan has to be based on creating a Palestinian state with the borders of 1967.This “quartet” idea would apparently be accepted by Russia, the UN, and the EU. In this respect the comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday are significant: He emphasized the need to listen to the Palestinians’ position, as well as that of the Arab League, but then also stated that Moscow “would really like for the quartet of international mediators, which are Russia, U.S.A., UN, and the EU, to review the situation.”Statements by European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, and by the spokesman for UN Secretary- General Stéphane Dujarric, also urged dialogue.g side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 lines.”  ",2,2,,,,,,,2318589788363490,/story.php?story_fbid=2318589788363490&id=2162254587330345

Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,,2020-01-28 21:16:32,"Clear the Decks for February Fight for Moon-Mars Mission Jan. 27, 2020 (EIRNS) — A NASA Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 2020 has been introduced by the House Science Committee, which makes of President Donald Trump’s Moon-Mars mission Artemis simply a Mars program, and would eliminate most of the lunar program. The Lunar Gateway would be changed to the Mars Gateway, and the lunar landing put back to NASA’s original date of 2028, which is described as an “interim goal” to the Mars landing in 2033. This fits with views consistently expressed last year by the Committee’s chair, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX); which in turn match those by Appropriations Subcommittee on Space chair Rep. José Serrano (D-NY). No to President Trump’s proposed crash program to return human beings to the Moon by 2024, and then develop lunar resources and capacities to launch to Mars. This while he fights the Democrats’ increasingly desperate impeachment coup. Crucially, the bill, introduced by Rep. Kendra Horn (D-OK), who chairs the Committee’s space subcommittee, eliminates in situ resource utilization on the Moon; i.e., getting water from lunar ice — which was one of NASA’s reasons for going to the Moon — and restricts any development of a “continously crewed lunar outpost or research station.” The counter to the ill-conceived attempt to bypass the Moon is the full-scale development of its many resources, including helium-3, by the Krafft Ehricke program. This approach is being followed by Chinese scientists, and eloquently supported by geologist and Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmitt. The goal of the Chinese lunar program is to integrate the resources, most notably helium-3, and industrial development of the Moon with the economy of the Earth; to make use of the unique features of the Moon, such as the “quiet” far side, for scientific studies, as for astronomy; and to be a test bed for the technologies needed for further deep space exploration. The subcommittee is scheduled to mark up the bill on Jan. 29. Then the full committee will take up the bill, before it goes to the full House. A major battle must be waged in February for the entire four-year extra NASA funding (perhaps $25 billion over FY2021-24) to carry out the Artemis Moon-Mars mission as a crash program. The coup attempt against President Trump, now in its desperate and dragged-out impeachment phase, must be defeated now, to clear the decks for that fight.",2,2,,,,,,,2317332388489230,/story.php?story_fbid=2317332388489230&id=2162254587330345

Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,,2019-09-12 09:06:27,"Pennacchio Introduces Bills Promoting Fusion Power into New Jersey State Senate Sept. 11 (EIRNS)—Six bills were introduced into the New Jersey state legislature Aug. 26 by Sen. Joseph Pennacchio, for the promotion of fusion energy research in New Jersey and as part of a call for a national “crash fusion program.” On Sept. 9, Pennacchio’s office issued a press release entitled “Pennacchio Seeks To Make N.J. a Leader in Fusion Energy.” On May 23 the Senator sponsored a symposium at the State House Annex, moderated by EIR’s Marsha Freeman, on “What Are the Prospects and Requirements for the Early Development of Fusion Energy, and What Are the Implications for the U.S., New Jersey, and the World?” The symposium brought experts in fusion energy research together with state political representatives, students, and interested citizens. Speakers included the science director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, and presidents of several New Jersey companies working on fusion development and spin-offs. The bills introduced Aug. 26 follow up proposals by participants at the symposium, and reflect the Senator’s support for fusion energy development. EIR gave full coverage of the symposium in its June 7 issue, titled, “ ‘Commercial Fusion Not Soon Enough’ Says N.J. State Sen. Joseph Pennacchio.” A video of the full symposium has been posted to Vimeo by Panoramic Reign Photography. In his introductory remarks Senator Pennacchio said: “It has been estimated that by 2025 we could have a sustainable fusion reaction, and commercial applications somewhere around 2050. That, in my humble opinion, is not soon enough. The problems that we have ... for instance in space travel, we have to get a new propulsion system that can overcome those challenges. One of the ways to allow intergalactic and interplanetary travel in the future. Imagine the benefits that men and women can reap from its development, and not only the main energy application of fusion, but the ancillary applications, like we had with the space program. Myself, and the other legislators in this building, we need to know how we can help that; how can we nurture and help this game-changer come into being. “Imagine if this energy—this is special now—imagine if it had bipartisan support; imagine if it had the support of the environmentalists; imagine if countries like the United States, Russia, and China and Europe worked together.” Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed such a cooperative “crash program” for fusion power in his remarks to Second Global Manufacturing and Industrialization Summit on July 9, available on the Kremlin website. Throughout the Trenton hearing, references to the Apollo Mission were made as a source of inspiration to scientists who have dedicated their lives to developing such breakthroughs as fusion energy. The new commitment to a Moon mission was also mentioned by students who were in attendance, who asked how the optimism in the room could be transferred to today’s young students, who are worried about shootings in their classrooms and other violence. The package of bills establish a New Jersey Fusion Technology Industry Commission; establish a program to promote fusion technology industry and attract fusion technology businesses; provide that fusion energy and fusion technology companies are eligible to receive benefits under certain economic incentive programs; require that fusion be included within the definition of Class I renewable energy as defined in the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act; and (SR 146) urge Congress to increase funding for fusion energy research. They would also establish a scholarship program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in fusion science. A follow-up resolution is expected, calling for national support for a fusion crash program, as in the McCormack Fusion Bill, passed and signed—but never funded—in 1980. Other states can mobilize for such an endeavor.",7,7,,,,,,,2199988390223631,/story.php?story_fbid=2199988390223631&id=2162254587330345

In fact, the Fed, the BOE, the ECB, the IMF, and the BOJ are ALL colluding to prevent credit from going to productive purposes across the world! His present tactic, expressed in the below tweet, IS NOT GOING TO WORK. Printing money at the Fed and keeping with the Fed’s “new normal” of near-zero interest rates will only exacerbate the rate at which the financial bubble starves physical productive activity.  It’s time to settle on LaRouche’s Four Laws:  1. We need a return to Glass-Steagall, to sort out and cancel the nonperforming debt in the system (instead of artificially supporting asset prices with QE). 2. We need a Hamiltonian National Bank to take over the creation of national credit from the bankrupt Federal Reserve. While the Fed’s “mandate” is to hit “inflation target” (prop up toxic financial assets), a Hamiltonian National Bank purpose is to organize credit towards those projects which will increase the overall physical productivity of the economy. 3. Trillions of dollars of that Public Credit must be extended towards the construction of massive new infrastructure projects creating millions of highly productive jobs. Look toward the requirements of a much more densely populated USA forty years from now, and work backwards to determine what transportation, energy, and water projects need be begun today. 4.

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2019-08-26 15:40:02,"In the latest round of escalation of trade warfare between the U.S. and China, President Donald Trump issued a series of tweets on Aug. 23, including one that stated: “We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.” The following day, that view received a prompt and explicit response from China, in an editorial of Xinhua, the official news agency of the People’s Republic of China: “The U.S. economy will not be stronger without China. Any discussion of severing ties between U.S. and Chinese companies is ridiculous at best.... Constructive engagement is still the right way forward.” Helga Zepp-LaRouche went even further, stating that it is simply objectively wrong to think that the U.S. or the world can solve its economic problems without China, and its Belt and Road Initiative; just as it is objectively wrong to think it is possible to solve the planet’s strategic problems without Russia. The British Empire and those in Europe and inside the U.S. who share their policies, have orchestrated a dramatic worsening of the strategic situation over the last few weeks on all fronts, Zepp-LaRouche added. Official Washington is moving from characterizing China as a competitor, then a rival, and now there is explicit talk of China being an enemy. The same is happening with the sharp escalation of ballistic missile testing which is targeting both Russia and China. Whatever the points of pressure or manipulation around President Trump on these matters, Zepp-LaRouche stated, they must be broken to shake him and the U.S. government loose from the current trajectory, which is extremely dangerous and will be devastating for the U.S. generally and for Trump’s reelection specifically. It is a trajectory which is the exact opposite of what Lyndon LaRouche called for, with his Four Powers proposal, for the U.S., China, Russia and India to cooperate on stopping the British Empire’s wars and looting, and instead establish a new world order based on science and classical culture. The driving force behind the strategic phase-change that the British have orchestrated over the last few weeks on multiple fronts, is the utter, imminent bankruptcy of their entire financial system. They are openly scheming about “a regime change in monetary policy” that will make the $17 trillion in total quantitative easing to date pale in comparison. They are intending to implement a “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” to make all semblance of national sovereignty over monetary and credit policy disappear, and force all credit flows into keeping their $1.5 quadrillion speculative bubble afloat, including with “green” boondoggles whose only purpose is to wipe out what little remains of productive industrial economies. And yet, as Lyndon LaRouche proved conclusively, there is no conceivable way they can salvage their system, regardless of the hyperinflationary firestorms they unleash. Only the bankruptcy reorganization of the entire system, with Glass-Steagall and related measures, can work, and get the planet off its current suicidal trajectory. President Trump’s next tweet really ought to say: “We don’t need the City of London and Wall Street and, frankly, would be far better off without them.” That would be true; it would be in keeping with Trump’s own campaign promises; and most importantly, it would be the beginning of the kind of immediate policy shift the country requires.",1,1,,,,,,,2188637961358674,/story.php?story_fbid=2188637961358674&id=2162254587330345

Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,,2019-08-06 22:51:57,"Dear friends, Tonight I enjoyed meeting Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard briefly, after hearing her speak in Manhattan. In meeting her, I informed her of my US Senate campaign in New Jersey, and called on her to support the space program and the exoneration of Lyndon LaRouche. My friend Margaret and I gave her copies of the LaRouchePAC pamphlet, “The Case for the Exoneration of Lyndon LaRouche” as well as our petition to President Trump to cause that exoneration, and our most recent petition, “Commit to a Moon-Mars Mission!” I came away from the meeting thinking of how important it is for Tulsi to learn of LaRouche’s life’s work.  She spoke with passion about the need to end the regime change wars and unjustified economic sanctions on other nations, but did not present a clear vision of what this new paradigm of relations should look like. She made clear her opposition to the New Cold War, as she and Stephen Cohen call it, which, she was clear, threatens to become nuclear world war — but she presented no solution concept by which to overcome that danger. She spoke about a need for a living wage, for better jobs and healthcare — but what is the physical basis for creating a dramatic increase in the productivity of the US economy? These are questions to which I have answers, on account of my study of the work of Lyndon LaRouche, and my Senate campaign is devoted to causing these essential policy questions to be addressed.  Our future is a positive development in the human species, not merely the negation of what has gone wrong over past decades. Our future demands the creation of a new, more noble identity of humanity, not merely the end of oligarchy. Our future, in fact, lives on the Moon and Mars, and further out into our solar system and many galaxies beyond our own. Only with that quality of vision can we navigate through the treacherous waters we find ourselves in today — with a clear repudiation of the Malthusian green fascism, and the adoption of a fifty year scientific mission for the United States and the world. Thank you, Daniel Burke Candidate for US Senate in New Jersey",95,79,,14,2,,,,2175755982646872,/story.php?story_fbid=2175755982646872&id=2162254587330345

"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2019-07-24 14:01:23,"The world is engulfed in a wave of cultural optimism as it recalls the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon 50 years ago, and ponders the prospects of applying that same Kennedy-esque “can-do” approach to the daunting tasks facing humanity today. A leading obstacle in the way of the kind of international cooperation needed for our next step as a space-faring species, is the anti-China campaign being promoted by leading Establishment circles in the United Kingdom and the United States today. The problem was evident at the recent space conference in Zhuhai, China, which brought together leading scientists from China, Russia, India, Europe and other nations—but not the United States—to discuss a joint effort to build a Moon research station. “The U.S. is shooting itself in the foot by not participating in such international cooperation,” Helga Zepp- LaRouche said today. The British geopolitical campaign which views China as an opponent and even an enemy—as repeated in a Sunday New York Times Editorial Board statement—is “wrong thinking” which needs to end, and end fast, she said. We are at the dawn of a new age of civilization, in which Man will industrialize the Moon and colonize Mars. President Trump’s announcement that “We are going” to the Moon by 2024, as a stepping stone to Mars, carries the right spirit, but few of the economic and scientific policy specifics required to actually fulfill that mission. Those have been provided by visionary space scientist Krafft Ehricke, and by the renowned statesman Lyndon LaRouche, who presented, over 30 years ago, the policies required to carry out such a project. It can be scientifically asserted, Zepp-LaRouche stated in a discussion with associates, that for that reason the exoneration of LaRouche and Mankind’s required space policy are one and the same issue. “I think the most important thing is that you got a glimpse of what kind of human spirit is possible, once people concentrate on the common aims of mankind, on the tremendous creative potential of the human species to overcome every limitation, as Krafft Ehricke said, and as Lyndon LaRouche devoted his entire life’s work to this idea. The two issues—space exploration and LaRouche’s exoneration—are really one and the same thing. “Because once he is exonerated, there would be a complete exploration and discussion of his ideas. Every student, every person could start to read LaRouche’s works in an unprejudiced way. The creative potential which would be unleashed by doing that is huge: his conceptions in almost every field of knowledge are the most advanced, and only very few people have even an inkling of what the scientific debate is, for example, between a Riemannian universe conception and that of the reductionist-deductionist approach. “Once you have an unmediated discussion about that, this would be like the introduction of Plato into the fertile ferment of the Italian Renaissance, in which Nikolaus of Cusa was the founder of the modern nation-state, and modern science. “The two times Europe came out of a dark age, going into a Renaissance, they always would refer back to the highest ideas which were produced by mankind up to that point, which meant the Italian Renaissance went back to the ancient Greek Classic; and the German Classic went back to both the ancient Greek Classic and the Italian Renaissance, and naturally also Shakespeare, who was translated into German at a point when he was less known even in Great Britain. “Today we are in a dark age. And if we want to get out of this, we have to unleash the whole world—Chinese scholars, Indian scholars, Russian scholars—to look at LaRouche’s body of ideas in the same way as people look at Plato, and Cusa, and Leibniz, and Einstein. This is especially key now, with his ideas about a relativistic universe, which people have to consider once we start space travel. Once we go to Mars, it will not be by conventional propulsion, because that is just not bearable. “And once we go into a relativistic idea of the universe, as the precondition to travel safely to Mars, and later beyond, it means a complete revolution in the thinking of man, and that is why we need LaRouche’s entire works to be available, unprejudiced with all the slanders he has been subjected to. “So I think the excitement about this new revival of the ‘Moon fever,’ the Apollo 11 50th anniversary, has to be combined with the exoneration of LaRouche. And we should concentrate on the idea that Buzz Aldrin stated—he was the only one who has mentioned this—that we need an international united space alliance for this to happen.”",5,4,,1,,,,,2173543819534755,/story.php?story_fbid=2173543819534755&id=2162254587330345
"Daniel Burke For U.S. Senate,Lyndon LaRouche PAC",,2019-08-01 13:46:06,"The Extinction Rebellion (XR), spawned in the UK last October and now spreading rapidly across Europe and the United States, must not be taken lightly as merely psychotic lunacy, although it is that as well. Their intention is not hidden — the destruction of modern industrial civilization. The founding declaration, published in The Guardian on Oct. 26, 2018, signed by 94 academics, politicians, and social activists, states that governments are guilty of ""failing to acknowledge that infinite economic growth on a planet with finite resources is non-viable."" This fundamental lie — that we live in a world of scarce resources — was refuted by Lyndon LaRouche in his 1983 book There Are No Limits To Growth. Based on that lie, the XR declaration concludes: ""it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government's inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself."" The authors were Dr. Alison Green, a psychologist at England's Arden University, and Molly Scott Cato, a British Member of the European Parliament from the British Green Party, who is not only anti-carbon but also a raving anti-nuclear campaigner (demonstrating that the XR intention is not actually anti-carbon, but anti-industry and anti-science). The signers include former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who encourages children to skip school — a ""children's crusade"" — to demand de-industrialization. A large number of the signers are psychiatrists, and, not surprisingly, XR prides itself on being modeled on ""The Committee of 100"", Bertrand Russell's civil disobedience movement from 1960. It was Russell — described by Lyndon LaRouche as the ""most evil man of the 20th Century,"" who described ""mass psychology"" as the most important tool for politics: ""Its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda,"" Russell wrote in his 1952 book The Impact of Science on Society. ""Of these the most influential is what is called 'education.' Religion plays a part, though a diminishing one; the press, the cinema, and the radio play an increasing part. What is essential in mass psychology is the art of persuasion. If you compare a speech of Hitler's with a speech of (say) Edmund Burke, you will see what strides have been made in the art since the eighteenth century. What went wrong formerly was that people had read in books that man is a rational animal, and framed their arguments on this hypothesis.... It may be hoped that in time anybody will be able to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and is provided by the State with money and equipment."" The XR is now shutting down traffic and defacing monuments, but can be expected to proceed to terrorist attacks on CO2-producing factories and power plants soon. They are fascists, even though their shirts are green rather than brown. They are at the center of the ongoing destruction of Germany, the leading industrial nation of Europe. A key speaker at the ongoing five-day conference of XR in Dortmund is Christoph Schmidt, who has been Chancellor Angela Merkel's leading economic adviser for the past ten years, during which the German government has begun the total shut-down of nuclear power and the closure of all coal-fired power plants, planning to survive primarily on windmills and solar panels. The international XR movement is also targetting the United States, focussed on the September UN Climate Action Summit in New York. This demonic movement must be exposed and repudiated, but that will only be successful if the populations of Europe and the US are at the same time given the tools to break through the cultural and psychological warfare. Never has the opportunity to do exactly that been greater than it is today, as a primary result of the enthusiasm and optimism awakened by the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon Landing, together with the announcement by President Donald Trump and NASA chief Jim Bridenstine of the Artemis Moon-Mars project, to return to the Moon by 2024 in a crash program, and to stay there, building the industrial and scientific capacity to serve as the base for human travel to Mars and beyond. The LaRouchePAC petition, ""We Commit to the Moon-Mars Mission"" is aimed at providing that spark of creativity and optimism, especially in the youth, who have been denied that vision of the future since the assassination of John Kennedy, the Indochina War, and the prosecution of Lyndon LaRouche. The exoneration of LaRouche today can, and must, awaken American patriots and citizens of the world to the reality of the lost decades since his ideas were suppressed, by the same British imperial forces now being exposed as the instigators of the failed coup attempt against President Trump.",4,3,,,1,,,,2173543739534763,/story.php?story_fbid=2173543739534763&id=2162254587330345

Our future lives on the Moon and Mars! https://action.larouchepac.com/moon_mars?recruiter_id=28707 We, the undersigned, pledge our commitment to the following program, and we call upon President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress to commit to it as well.  Successfully realize the Artemis mission to bring mankind—including the first woman—to the Moon to stay in 2024, as President Trump and his NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine have called for. Make Artemis the first step towards the industrialization of the Moon, as the economic platform enabling human colonization of Mars and human exploration of the Solar System—as first thoroughly defined by the late space visionary Krafft Ehricke. Develop advanced fusion propulsion spacecraft, fueled by the helium-3 resources on the Moon—enabling safe and rapid human travel to Mars and other regions in the Solar System, with the goal of achieving constant one-gravity acceleration/deceleration as the standard for human interplanetary missions.  Achieve this Moon-Mars program through an international 50-year crash program, as outlined by the late economist Lyndon LaRouche—ensuring the high rates of economic payback on Earth which can only be reached by developing new space and fusion technologies, and sharing those technologies internationally as the basis for durable peace on this planet.  Reform or eliminate the speculative and predatory aspects of the international financial system, as a necessary step to ensure sovereign nations can generate the long-term credit agreements needed to facilitate this mission.  Remove barriers to international collaboration in space—especially impediments to U.S. cooperation with China and Russia (as typified by the so-called Wolf Amendment, barring NASA from working with China).  This program coheres with remarks made by Lyndon LaRouche to a December 2009 international conference in Russia: In order to realize the objectives which stand before us now, we have to give mankind a new mission—mankind as a whole. The mission is typified by the idea of the Mars colonization. This requires us to make the kinds of changes, in terms of scientific progress, which are needed for mankind's future existence. We have many problems on this planet. And we can not solve those problems, extensively, without going into a development of the Solar System as a habitat of mankind. We're on the edge of doing that, scientifically. There are many scientific discoveries, yet to be made, which will make it possible to act for man's colonization of Mars. That will be in some time to come. But what we need now is the intention of accomplishing the Mars colonization program. We need to educate and develop generations of young people, who will be oriented to that kind of mission. In the coming period, we will have the birth of young people who will be part of the colonization of Mars, in one way or the other, before this century is out. We need to give mankind a sense of purpose, developmental purpose, not only throughout the planet, but through the influence of Earth on the adjoining regions of the Solar System, and beyond. Those objectives are feasible. There are, admittedly, many problems to be solved, scientific problems, which are not yet resolved. We have many questions. But, essentially, we know this is feasible. We know this should be feasible within two or three generations. What we have to do, is give to people, who will be the grandchildren, born now, to give them something to realize. When we're dead and gone, they will be there, three generations from now, four generations from now. They will be the people who actually colonize areas beyond Earth itself. We need to give them the opportunity to do so. We need to give society, in the meantime, the mission-orientation of achieving that colonization, for our descendants, three generations or so down the line.",7,7,,,,,,,2168430583379412,/story.php?story_fbid=2168430583379412&id=2162254587330345
