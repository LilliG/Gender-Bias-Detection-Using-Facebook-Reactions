Michael LaPierre for U.S. Senate,,2020-05-01 17:52:42,"Nate Leupp Greenville County Chair ......What am I missing from the last time Greenville County censured Senator Graham? He still believes in climate change, he still believes in a tax on our carbon footprint, he still does not want Roe v. Wade overturned (decision that has allowed 65 million babies to be slaughtered), he still wants illegal immigrants to get citizenship, he now wants Bill Gates at the head of the WTO, he now thinks President Trump is a race-bating xenophobe, he now thinks that Adam Schiff did a good job and was very well spoken during the impeachment trial, he now does not think that Chuck Schumer should be censured for attacking Supreme Court Justices with threats.

Bill Gates, the one who experimented on children in India for his vaccine pet projects, killing thousands. Bill Gates who wants it to be mandatory for every American to get a vaccine he funds for the Coronavirus.  This is UNACCEPTABLE.

Michael LaPierre for U.S. Senate,,2020-04-17 12:10:44,"***Dire warning*** The people of South Carolina don't see a big enough contrast between Lindsey Graham and Jaime Harrison's policy positions. Just like the 2016 Presidential election cycle where Graham only polled at 1%, the people of South Carolina are likewise confused about Lindsey Graham and what he stands for. Is Graham a Democrat or a RINO? Herein lies the confusion…. Michael LaPIERRE is the clear Conservative choice and the best contrast to Jamie Harrison.  Lindsey Graham will NOT win in November. Michael LaPIERRE is the clear South Carolina Primary choice. I honestly believe that the 1% presidential poll numbers are markers for his confused messaging.  Does the question of ""is Lindsey a Democrat or a RINO?” really fit the values of the Republican Party and the Conservatives of South Carolina? He is one of the two! But, are a majority of South Carolinians one of the two? This question should keep us awake at night. Lindsey Graham is too close to the Democrat choice. I fear that if he were chosen as the “Republican” candidate, the chances of the seat turning Democrat is a very real possibility. There must be a clear delineation between the parties. And Graham blurs that line all too well.  Conservative South Carolinians, where are you? It’s time for a return back to Conservatism. It’s time to make a CLEAR choice!

"Michael LaPierre for U.S. Senate,Laird Minor",,2020-04-12 12:54:55,"Spoken like a well-educated attorney and someone who understands the law! Thank you Laird for giving us keen insight into this legal crisis!The Governor is Wrong The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 cannot be denied, and neither can its effect on certain regions of the United States (NY, LA, CA, etc.). Draconian measures to protect public health in those areas are appropriate and necessary. But most parts of the country have not been significantly affected, except by their own ill-considered actions. South Carolina is no exception.  On March 13 Governor McMaster declared a State of Emergency because of this pandemic. Since then he has issued a series of Executive Orders (currently totaling 13 in all) imposing increasingly draconian restrictions on the activities of the residents of this state. No one disputes the wisdom of taking appropriate actions to protect our health. Sanitary measures (washing hands, disinfecting surfaces, wearing gloves and masks, etc.) are certainly sensible, as is practicing “social distancing” (to the extent practicable) and staying home when sick. Persons who are at increased risk (such as the elderly and those suffering from other medical conditions) should be extra cautious, and those experiencing symptoms of the virus should self-quarantine. It was (and remains) correct for the Governor to encourage such practices. However, in nearly every other respect the Governor’s orders have been completely wrong.  Let’s examine a few of them individually. Hospitals were ordered to cancel all elective surgeries. As a consequence, every hospital in this state is nearly empty and all are suffering great economic distress. Nurses and other staff have been furloughed; doctors put ”on-call” but are not being called; essentially every revenue source has been eliminated. Yet all the fixed costs and many of the variable ones remain. Many of our rural hospitals are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and even the largest are hemorrhaging cash. The cancellation order was simply wrong: elective surgeries should only have been cancelled once the demand for hospital beds and facilities increased to the point that it became necessary. To date it has not been necessary, and it probably will never become so. The financial damage to our hospitals and our health care system generally, which directly affects us all, was unnecessary. Restaurants were ordered to close, except for take-out and delivery services. With the exception of fast-food and chain pizza restaurants, most are not set up for that. Their fixed costs have not diminished, but their revenues have been choked off. This was unnecessary. Social distancing could be accomplished by simply separating diners and skipping every other table. People fearing exposure could simply stay home; patronage would be entirely voluntary. The Governor’s order is driving many small, independent restaurants out of business, in many cases permanently, for no good reason. Better options were available.  “Essential” businesses have been permitted to remain open, which is good. We all need to buy food and medicines. But the effect has been to concentrate all shopping in a relatively small number of retail establishments. If suppressing the transmission of COVID-19 is the goal, this is absolutely the worst way to go about it. Other stores could have been permitted to remain open with appropriate sanitary and social distancing practices adopted. Instead, the Governor simply closed them.  And what about all other types of businesses? Office workers aren’t at any particular risk; even if they don’t have private offices, most work in cubicles which provide appropriate separation. The same is true for most other types of businesses. Very few cannot adapt to a reasonable degree of social distancing. And those which cannot (such as barbers and hair stylists, which necessarily require close personal contact) could employ protective gear such as masks, gloves, and face shields.  People need to continue to work. They need the income. The state is unnecessarily denying them that ability. Better, less restrictive alternatives were available, but were ignored (or not even considered). The state is committing economic suicide. Few small businesses have the cash reserves to survive closure for any extended period of time. Businesses will be destroyed, savings wiped out, and lives ruined. It is well established that economic distress has huge non-economic costs. It is a direct cause of suicide, domestic violence, divorce, and a myriad of other social ills. The economic health of the state and its residents is an important consideration which appears to have been completely ignored in the panic over the virus. That is a serious error.  It will undoubtedly be claimed that I am more concerned with money than lives. That is not only dishonest and wrong, it actually puts things backward. Proponents of the oppressive economic restrictions imposed by the Governor, who claim to be concerned about preserving lives, are in fact only concerned with some lives. They are ignoring a huge group of other lives: those which will be lost or irreparably damaged by the economic shutdown of our state.  The Governor has grossly over-reacted to this pandemic. The medical impact on this state has been relatively modest; at present we have a total of 2,417 confirmed cases in a state of over 5 million people. Undoubtedly there will be more, but not as many as is being asserted. Every single model which projects infection rates, hospital bed utilization and fatalities has grossly overestimated the numbers. Every. Single. One. All are being revised downward massively, by many multiples if not by orders of magnitude. And if the effect will not be as massive as has been projected, neither should the state’s response to it. We are completely ignoring proportionality.  In the long run, the economic harm wrought by these ill-considered directives will cost more lives than they save. And the collateral damage will persist for decades.",92,78,1,12,1,,,,518222799123313,/story.php?story_fbid=518222799123313&id=290219498590312

Michael LaPierre for U.S. Senate,,2020-02-14 09:43:42,President Trump is aggressively trying to tighten the noose around illegal immigration! I believe he needs to expand his National Emergency powers and bring more military personnel to our Southern border. We have uncontrolled terrorist activity (drug cartels) that is destroying portions of America. Let’s seal our borders in FULL. President Trump has the “tested” and legal authority to do so. His recent action designating the drug cartels as terrorist organizations is the predicate he should use to keep our country safe and enforce our laws.,33,25,,8,,,,,478137066465220,/story.php?story_fbid=478137066465220&id=290219498590312
"Michael LaPierre for U.S. Senate,Berkeley County Republican Party",,2020-02-10 21:19:49,"Victoria and the BCGOP leadership are fantastic. Their honesty and fairness in the way they present political views, host political candidates and make information available to their members is admirable and to be praised. Thank you friends at BCGOP. God bless you!As the Chair of the BCGOP, and joyful leader of an awesome team and county party, I just had to share some kudos we’ve been receiving.   For those that don’t know, we held an awesome 1st Congressional District Candidate Engagement Event in October which received  rave reviews of its format from the audience and candidates alike.   This month, we held another Candidate Engagement Event—this time for the Senate Candidates.  Again the format, created by the BCGOP, received rave reviews and many gracious thanks from the Candidates.  But the best part of this event was that it was likely the only one of it’s kind to welcome these Candidates so far in the state.  And our team pulled off both events with grace and a conscious effort to ensure every attendee had an awesome experience. And just in case you’re unfamiliar with our routine, I’ll share that at every breakfast and business meeting, we receive, welcome and offer recognition for every elected official and every candidate present.   And with the primaries afoot, even when some among us wish we would come out ahead of a primary for their candidate, they know we won’t, that we can’t—and they are all being so great about it.  They know choosing sides prior to a primary would be divisive to our group and counter productive to our party’s goals of post-primary unity and effectiveness.   So if you’re looking for an awesome group of welcoming Republicans who are doing the best job ever—look no further.  This is the group for you!

Michael LaPierre for U.S. Senate,,2019-11-03 17:11:15,Let us be REAL CLEAR on why Senator Graham is stepping down as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is a friend of the Democrats. Our President wants a comprehensive investigation into the Democrats illegal behavior during the 2016 election tampering scam and Graham wants nothing to do with it. He has repeatedly said that Joe Biden and other Democrats are his GOOD friends. He doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to take this on with 100% commitment. Senator Graham is a historical fence rider and doesn't have the stomach to do what is right. His answer......step down!  Wrong Way Senator Graham!!! What you will see from him next year is a half hearted and protracted shell game that will be full of delays and postponements that will ultimately get him out of the hot seat.,60,40,1,4,3,1,11,,396861231259471,/story.php?story_fbid=396861231259471&id=290219498590312

Wade  • Oppose all forms of legislation that are aimed at controlling our guns and limiting our right to bear arms and the right to due process under the law  • The Team LaPierre For Christ political committee will assemble a team of political consultants, advisors,  and volunteers who abide by the rule of law, are concerned with rebuilding the moral and spiritual foundations of South Carolina, and desire to manifest lives that are above reproach   • Drive and support legislation that will help South Carolinians thrive economically • Oppose import tariffs that threaten great harm to our state • Propose and support all legislation that removes regulatory barriers and unnecessary red tape • Support a Constitutional Amendment that defines marriage between a man and a woman  • Advocate for an educational system that brings primary responsibility back to the state level through strategic initiatives including vouchers, ESA accounts, tax credits, and private school choice options that helps to raise the educational performance bar in South Carolina for both students and teachers • Oppose the Equality Act and any of its alternative forms so that we can keep South Carolina anchored to the principles of God’s Word and the moral and spiritual foundations necessary to help us thrive and grow • Legislate for the security of our sovereign borders through the construction of a wall; deportation of those who are in our country illegally; close loopholes detrimental to legal immigration and our national safety; rewrite the existing asylum laws; and use all diplomatic, economic, and national emergency means necessary (military) to keep our country from harm • Champion the cause of prayer in our public schools; Bible education through Released Time programs and other faith-based training models; along with a traditional view of history and how Christian principles have been the “salt and light” and guided our country toward American exceptionalism   • As a former athlete at both the collegiate and professional levels, be the torch bearer for those parents who do not want to see their children exposed to the unfair and harmful effects of transgenderism in public facilities and in sporting events    • Limit myself to 2 terms and propose legislation for term limits at the congressional level that will help diminish the influence of lobbyists, professional political operatives, and other institution bureaucrats who are more concerned with power than they are with laws that promote the general welfare of our state and country • Donate a majority of my salary to charity and other nonprofit institutions in order to take a leadership position on this issue and set the tone for future elected Senators from South Carolina and beyond  • Refuse the elite health care program offered to U.S. Senators and maintain my current middleclass participant “share program” • Expose the socialist element on our shores and work to educate the people of South Carolina of its devastating and negative impact to liberty, freedom, and economic mobility • Support a strong military (peace through strength as a deterrent) and take care of our veterans   • Oppose Supreme Court Justices that have a predisposition toward a progressive, liberal, and elastic view of our Constitution vs. a traditional and originalist approach • Be true to my beliefs and make decisions that are good for South Carolina without the intrusion of alternative political ambition and motive • Strive to be a public servant and servant leader vs. a politician and professional political operative  • In sum, advocate for “The New Frontier of Christian Conservatism” that helps restore the principles of God’s Word, morality, decency, and a love for our fellow citizens",598,530,10,55,,1,2,,303626807249581,/story.php?story_fbid=303626807249581&id=290219498590312
